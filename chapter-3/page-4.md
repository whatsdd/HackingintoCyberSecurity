Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency has become a popular form of digital currency that allows for decentralized and secure transactions without the need for a central authority. While cryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry, it has also attracted the attention of criminals who use it to facilitate cybercrime. Cryptocurrency offers a high level of anonymity, which makes it difficult to trace the origin of transactions and the identity of the parties involved. This anonymity has made it easier for criminals to launder money and conduct illegal activities without being detected. In addition, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices has made it possible for criminals to earn large profits through cyber attacks. As a result, it is important for law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity professionals to monitor the use of cryptocurrency and develop strategies to prevent its abuse.

Smart Devices

The proliferation of smart devices and the Internet of Things (the universe of devices that are not traditional computers, but that are connected to the Internet) means that unhackable solid state machines are being quickly replaced with devices that can potentially be controlled by hackers halfway around the world. Smart devices can be a security risk because they often have weak security measures in place, making them vulnerable to cyber attacks. In addition, the sheer number of smart devices that are connected to the internet increases the surface area for potential attacks, making it more difficult to secure all of these devices.

Big Data

Big data refers to the large amounts of data that are collected, stored, and analyzed by organizations. While big data is helping facilitate the creation of many cybersecurity technologies, it also creates opportunities for attackers. By correlating large amounts of information about the people working for an organization, for example, a criminal can more easily than before identify ideal methods for social engineering their way into the organization or locate and exploit possible vulnerabilities in the organizationâ€™s infrastructure.
