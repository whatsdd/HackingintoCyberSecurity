While both cyberspace and virtual reality involve simulated experiences, they have different orientations. Cyberspace refers to the plane of reality within which virtual reality experiences can occur, while virtual reality refers to the simulated experiences themselves.

To understand the difference between the two concepts, it can be helpful to consider the way that humans experience reality in physical space. Humans relate to reality through their five senses, and this sense of reality can also be applied to imagined objects. Cyberspace is a frame of reference in which people can have quasi-real experiences with such objects, while virtual reality refers to the simulated experiences with these objects.

It's worth noting that the concept of reality extends beyond physical experiences and can also include non-physical events or phenomena, such as emotions. In this sense, virtual reality may be seen as a false reality that can be experienced virtually. The question of reality raises a number of philosophical questions that go beyond current epistemological models, which tend to prioritize sense perception.

#### 2. What is Exactly Cyber Security ?

Cybersecurity Means Different Things to Different Folks‚Äù

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, servers, and other electronic devices from digital attacks. These attacks can take many forms, such as malware, hacking, and phishing, and can have a range of consequences, from theft of personal information to disruption of service. The term "cybersecurity" is often used to describe measures taken to protect against these types of attacks, but the specific measures taken can vary significantly depending on the context in which they are implemented.

For individuals, cybersecurity may involve protecting personal data and devices from unauthorized access and ensuring that they are free from malware. For small businesses, it may involve protecting credit card data and implementing data security standards at point-of-sale registers. For firms conducting online business, it may involve protecting servers that are accessed by untrusted outsiders. For shared service providers, it may involve protecting data centers that host servers for multiple organizations. For governments, it may involve establishing different classifications of data and implementing related laws, policies, procedures, and technologies to protect it.

Technically speaking, cybersecurity is a subset of information security that specifically addresses electronic information and systems, while information security encompasses all forms of data. However, in practice, the terms are often used interchangeably, and many people consider information security measures that are technically outside the scope of cybersecurity to be part of it. It's important to carefully consider the specific threats and vulnerabilities that need to be addressed in order to effectively implement cybersecurity measures.
