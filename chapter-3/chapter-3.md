**Origin of Cyberspace. (Cyberspace - New World Encyclopedia):**

The concept of "cyberspace" encompasses more than just the Internet. It can also include other forms of digital technology, such as computer networks and virtual reality. In this digital realm, issues related to intellectual property and copyright infringement can arise. Additionally, cyberspace has become a place for building relationships and communities. Some people believe that the ability for people to communicate and share ideas across borders brings the world closer together, while others argue that people will continue to associate with those who have similar interests and backgrounds. Regardless, the Internet and other forms of cyberspace have made it easier to disseminate ideas and values quickly. While the free exchange of information in cyberspace is valuable, it's important to use this space responsibly in order to ensure its value for humanity. This requires a value-based perspective on the use of technology in cyberspace.

**Origin of the Term:**

The term "cyberspace" was first introduced by science fiction author William Gibson in his 1982 story "Burning Chrome" and gained widespread recognition through its use in his 1984 novel Neuromancer. In the novel, Gibson describes cyberspace as a "consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators" and a "graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system." Gibson later commented that he chose the term because it was evocative and buzzworthy, but had no real meaning behind it. Today, the term "cyberspace" is commonly used to refer to the digital realm, including the Internet and other forms of digital technology.

**Cyberspace as an Internet Metaphor:**

The term "cyberspace" is often used to refer to objects and identities that exist within the communication network of the Internet. This interpretation suggests that events taking place on the Internet do not occur in the physical location of the participants or servers, but rather "in cyberspace." In this sense, cyberspace is not meant to be equated with physical space, but rather with the abstract, mathematical concept of space. The concept of cyberspace therefore refers to the possibility of navigating and interacting with different pages and sites on the Internet, and the potential to encounter something unknown or unexpected.

Videogames also adopt the cyberspace metaphor by representing players as avatars on the screen and allowing them to engage with each other in a virtual space. However, current virtual reality technology has not yet advanced to the point where fully immersive virtual environments are practical.

Despite the fact that some of the more radical predictions about the impact of the global communication network on state influence have not come to fruition, the term "cyberspace" continues to be used and is often incorporated into the terminology of virtual communities, such as Linden Lab's Second Life. The metaphor of cyberspace has also been useful in shaping military strategies and has been adopted by the U.S. Department of Defense. However, it is important to note that the metaphor of cyberspace has its limitations, particularly when it becomes conflated with physical infrastructure.

1\. Cyberspace and virtual reality:

While both cyberspace and virtual reality involve simulated experiences, they have different orientations. Cyberspace refers to the plane of reality within which virtual reality experiences can occur, while virtual reality refers to the simulated experiences themselves.

To understand the difference between the two concepts, it can be helpful to consider the way that humans experience reality in physical space. Humans relate to reality through their five senses, and this sense of reality can also be applied to imagined objects. Cyberspace is a frame of reference in which people can have quasi-real experiences with such objects, while virtual reality refers to the simulated experiences with these objects.

It's worth noting that the concept of reality extends beyond physical experiences and can also include non-physical events or phenomena, such as emotions. In this sense, virtual reality may be seen as a false reality that can be experienced virtually. The question of reality raises a number of philosophical questions that go beyond current epistemological models, which tend to prioritize sense perception.

**2. What is Exactly Cyber Security ?**

Cybersecurity Means Different Things to Different Folks‚Äù

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, servers, and other electronic devices from digital attacks. These attacks can take many forms, such as malware, hacking, and phishing, and can have a range of consequences, from theft of personal information to disruption of service. The term "cybersecurity" is often used to describe measures taken to protect against these types of attacks, but the specific measures taken can vary significantly depending on the context in which they are implemented.

For individuals, cybersecurity may involve protecting personal data and devices from unauthorized access and ensuring that they are free from malware. For small businesses, it may involve protecting credit card data and implementing data security standards at point-of-sale registers. For firms conducting online business, it may involve protecting servers that are accessed by untrusted outsiders. For shared service providers, it may involve protecting data centers that host servers for multiple organizations. For governments, it may involve establishing different classifications of data and implementing related laws, policies, procedures, and technologies to protect it.

Technically speaking, cybersecurity is a subset of information security that specifically addresses electronic information and systems, while information security encompasses all forms of data. However, in practice, the terms are often used interchangeably, and many people consider information security measures that are technically outside the scope of cybersecurity to be part of it. It's important to carefully consider the specific threats and vulnerabilities that need to be addressed in order to effectively implement cybersecurity measures.

Cybersecurity Is a Constantly Moving Target:

Technological advancements have had a significant impact on cybersecurity. As new technologies are developed, they can create new risks that must be addressed in order to protect against digital attacks. Some key areas where technological changes have had a particularly significant impact on cybersecurity include:

Digital data: The transition to digital storage of information has made it more complex to control access to data and protect it from attacks. The move to email and chat has also moved a large amount of sensitive information to Internet-connected servers, while the shift from film to digital photography and videography has made it easier for criminals to steal or hold images ransom. The Internet of Things (IoT): The proliferation of connected devices, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has increased the number of potential entry points for attackers and made it more difficult to secure networks. Cloud computing: The use of cloud computing has made it possible for businesses to store and access data remotely, but it has also introduced new risks, such as data breaches and unauthorized access to data. Mobile devices: The widespread use of mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, has made it more difficult to protect against attacks, as these devices are often used to access sensitive data and are vulnerable to hacking and malware. Economic model shifts

Economic model shifts can also impact cybersecurity. For example, the move from a product-based economy

**The Internet:**

The Internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and do business, but it has also created new opportunities for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. The widespread adoption of online banking and e-commerce in the 1990s made it easier for hackers to steal money and goods through cyber attacks, which in turn increased the incentives for unethical individuals to enter the world of cybercrime. The rise of the Internet has also made it possible for hackers to disrupt businesses, manipulate elections, and steal large sums of money on a global scale, something that was unimaginable before the Internet era. It is important for individuals and organizations to stay vigilant and take steps to protect themselves against cyber threats in the age of the Internet.

Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency has become a popular form of digital currency that allows for decentralized and secure transactions without the need for a central authority. While cryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry, it has also attracted the attention of criminals who use it to facilitate cybercrime. Cryptocurrency offers a high level of anonymity, which makes it difficult to trace the origin of transactions and the identity of the parties involved. This anonymity has made it easier for criminals to launder money and conduct illegal activities without being detected. In addition, the volatile nature of cryptocurrency prices has made it possible for criminals to earn large profits through cyber attacks. As a result, it is important for law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity professionals to monitor the use of cryptocurrency and develop strategies to prevent its abuse.

Smart Devices

The proliferation of smart devices and the Internet of Things (the universe of devices that are not traditional computers, but that are connected to the Internet) means that unhackable solid state machines are being quickly replaced with devices that can potentially be controlled by hackers halfway around the world. Smart devices can be a security risk because they often have weak security measures in place, making them vulnerable to cyber attacks. In addition, the sheer number of smart devices that are connected to the internet increases the surface area for potential attacks, making it more difficult to secure all of these devices.

Big Data

Big data refers to the large amounts of data that are collected, stored, and analyzed by organizations. While big data is helping facilitate the creation of many cybersecurity technologies, it also creates opportunities for attackers. By correlating large amounts of information about the people working for an organization, for example, a criminal can more easily than before identify ideal methods for social engineering their way into the organization or locate and exploit possible vulnerabilities in the organization‚Äôs infrastructure.

3\. Understanding Digital Forensic:

Digital forensics is a fascinating and complex profession that involves using scientific principles, methodologies, and techniques to uncover and analyze digital evidence in the course of legal investigations. While the media may portray this field as glamorous and straightforward, the reality is that it requires a great deal of specialized training and skills to properly apply these principles and techniques. Digital forensics has evolved significantly since the 1960s, as the threat landscape has changed from simple cybercrimes to more sophisticated attacks. Today, it is a well-established discipline that adheres to the principles of forensic science, and is recognized for its comprehensive body of knowledge (CBK) of proven methodologies and techniques. Whether you are a seasoned professional or just starting out in digital forensics, it is an exciting field that offers endless opportunities for growth and development.

**Why is it Important ?**

According to the Locard exchange principle, every crime leaves behind some form of evidence, and every perpetrator takes something away with them. In the digital world, this can take the form of digital evidence that can be used in forensic investigations. It is crucial for organizations to understand the technical requirements for practicing digital forensics and to follow proper protocols in order to preserve the integrity and authenticity of this evidence. Failing to do so can result in compromised or lost evidence, evidence that is not admissible in court, and non-compliance with laws and regulations. It is essential for organizations to have a strong defense-in-depth strategy in place, which includes the proper handling of digital evidence, in order to effectively prosecute intruders and protect against cybercrime.

**Legal Aspects**

It is essential for organizations to consistently follow forensic science principles, methodologies, and techniques, even if the end goal of the investigation is not legal prosecution. This is because the investigation may still result in legal action, such as employee termination, and it is important that the evidence is collected and handled in a manner that is admissible in court. To ensure the integrity and authenticity of digital evidence, it is necessary to create an exact copy of the data, preserve the authenticity of the data through the use of cryptographic algorithms, establish a chain of custody, and record the actions taken by people during the different investigative phases. By following these guidelines, organizations can ensure that they are well-prepared to handle any legal proceedings that may arise as a result of their investigations.

4\. Networks and the Internet:

The internet is one of the most significant inventions of the 21st century, revolutionizing the way we communicate, work, and go about our daily lives. From paying bills online to ordering food and making international video calls, the internet has made many tasks faster, cheaper, and more convenient. With the proliferation of internet-enabled devices like smartphones and tablets, we can stay connected with the rest of the world no matter where we are. The internet has also changed the way we use traditional devices, such as TVs and phones, which can now be used for making calls, watching movies, and more through the internet.

But where did this revolutionary technology come from? The internet has a long and complex history, beginning with the development of computer networks in the 1960s. These early networks were primarily used by government agencies and research institutions, but as the technology evolved, the internet began to expand to include more users and applications. Today, the internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices, connecting people and businesses all over the world.

As the internet continues to evolve, it is clear that it will continue to play a central role in our lives and shape the way we live and work. It is hard to imagine a world without the internet, and it is clear that it has changed the course of human history in countless ways.

**DNS:**

Have you ever stopped to wonder how you can type in a website's name, like "www.uou.ac.in," rather than its corresponding IP address, like "104.28.2.92," and still access the website? The answer lies in the Domain Name System (DNS), a server that translates the human-readable website names into the numerical IP addresses that computers understand.

Every time you request a website by typing in its name, a process called DNS name resolution is initiated in the background. Your computer has a local database called the DNS cache, which stores the IP addresses of recently visited websites. If the IP address of the website you're trying to access isn't found in your local DNS cache, your computer will then check the DNS server of your Internet Service Provider (ISP). These servers also keep a cache of recently visited websites, so if the information isn't available there, the query is forwarded to the root name servers.

There are currently 13 root name servers, which include VeriSign Global Registry Services, the University of Southern California - Information Sciences Institute, Cogent Communications, and the University of Maryland, among others. These root name servers are responsible for publishing the root zone file, which designates the locations of the authoritative servers for various top-level domains (TLDs) such as ".org," ".com," ".biz," and ".in."

The TLD name servers function like switchboards, directing the request to the appropriate authoritative name server for the domain. These servers also store other useful information, including DNS records. The record of the address is then sent back to the requesting host computer through the TLD name servers, the ISP's DNS server, and the name servers. Each intermediate server stores the record of the IP address in its DNS cache so that it doesn't have to go through the process again if it receives the same request. If you request the same URL again, the DNS cache of your local host PC will return the IP address of the requested website.
