Digital forensics is a fascinating and complex profession that involves using scientific principles, methodologies, and techniques to uncover and analyze digital evidence in the course of legal investigations. While the media may portray this field as glamorous and straightforward, the reality is that it requires a great deal of specialized training and skills to properly apply these principles and techniques. Digital forensics has evolved significantly since the 1960s, as the threat landscape has changed from simple cybercrimes to more sophisticated attacks. Today, it is a well-established discipline that adheres to the principles of forensic science, and is recognized for its comprehensive body of knowledge (CBK) of proven methodologies and techniques. Whether you are a seasoned professional or just starting out in digital forensics, it is an exciting field that offers endless opportunities for growth and development.

#### Why is it Important ?

According to the Locard exchange principle, every crime leaves behind some form of evidence, and every perpetrator takes something away with them. In the digital world, this can take the form of digital evidence that can be used in forensic investigations. It is crucial for organizations to understand the technical requirements for practicing digital forensics and to follow proper protocols in order to preserve the integrity and authenticity of this evidence. Failing to do so can result in compromised or lost evidence, evidence that is not admissible in court, and non-compliance with laws and regulations. It is essential for organizations to have a strong defense-in-depth strategy in place, which includes the proper handling of digital evidence, in order to effectively prosecute intruders and protect against cybercrime.

#### Legal Aspects

It is essential for organizations to consistently follow forensic science principles, methodologies, and techniques, even if the end goal of the investigation is not legal prosecution. This is because the investigation may still result in legal action, such as employee termination, and it is important that the evidence is collected and handled in a manner that is admissible in court. To ensure the integrity and authenticity of digital evidence, it is necessary to create an exact copy of the data, preserve the authenticity of the data through the use of cryptographic algorithms, establish a chain of custody, and record the actions taken by people during the different investigative phases. By following these guidelines, organizations can ensure that they are well-prepared to handle any legal proceedings that may arise as a result of their investigations.
