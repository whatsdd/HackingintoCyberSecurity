Technological advancements have had a significant impact on cybersecurity. As new technologies are developed, they can create new risks that must be addressed in order to protect against digital attacks. Some key areas where technological changes have had a particularly significant impact on cybersecurity include:

Digital data: The transition to digital storage of information has made it more complex to control access to data and protect it from attacks. The move to email and chat has also moved a large amount of sensitive information to Internet-connected servers, while the shift from film to digital photography and videography has made it easier for criminals to steal or hold images ransom. The Internet of Things (IoT): The proliferation of connected devices, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has increased the number of potential entry points for attackers and made it more difficult to secure networks. Cloud computing: The use of cloud computing has made it possible for businesses to store and access data remotely, but it has also introduced new risks, such as data breaches and unauthorized access to data. Mobile devices: The widespread use of mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, has made it more difficult to protect against attacks, as these devices are often used to access sensitive data and are vulnerable to hacking and malware. Economic model shifts

Economic model shifts can also impact cybersecurity. For example, the move from a product-based economy

#### The Internet:

The Internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and do business, but it has also created new opportunities for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. The widespread adoption of online banking and e-commerce in the 1990s made it easier for hackers to steal money and goods through cyber attacks, which in turn increased the incentives for unethical individuals to enter the world of cybercrime. The rise of the Internet has also made it possible for hackers to disrupt businesses, manipulate elections, and steal large sums of money on a global scale, something that was unimaginable before the Internet era. It is important for individuals and organizations to stay vigilant and take steps to protect themselves against cyber threats in the age of the Internet.
