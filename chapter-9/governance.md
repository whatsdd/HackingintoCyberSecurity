### Introduction: What is Governance in Information Security and what is not. <a href="#_raipj2ahy342" id="_raipj2ahy342"></a>

**(**[Information Security Governance | EDUCAUSE](https://www.educause.edu/focus-areas-and-initiatives/policy-and-security/cybersecurity-program/resources/information-security-guide/toolkits/information-security-governance#InformationSecurityGovernance-what) **)**

IT security governance is the system by which an organization directs and controls IT security (adapted from ISO 38500). IT security governance should not be confused with IT security management. IT security management is concerned with making decisions to mitigate risks; governance determines who is authorized to make decisions. Governance specifies the accountability framework and provides oversight to ensure that risks are adequately mitigated, while management ensures that controls are implemented to mitigate risks. Management recommends security strategies. Governance ensures that security strategies are aligned with business objectives and consistent with regulations.

NIST describes IT governance as the process of establishing and maintaining a framework to provide assurance that information security strategies are aligned with and support business objectives, are consistent with applicable laws and regulations through adherence to policies and internal controls, and provide assignment of responsibility, all in an effort to manage risk.

Enterprise security governance results from the duty of care owed by leadership towards fiduciary requirements. This position is based on judicial rationale and reasonable standards of care. The five general governance areas are:

*
  1. Govern the operations of the organization and protect its critical assets
  2. Protect the organization's market share and stock price (perhaps not appropriate for education)
  3. Govern the conduct of employees (educational AUP and other policies that may apply for the use of technology resources, data handling, etc.)
  4. Protect the reputation of the organization
  5. Ensure compliance requirements are met

"Governing for enterprise security means viewing adequate security as a non-negotiable requirement of being in business."

Governance: doing the right thing.

Management: doing things right.

**Characteristics of effective security governance**

The eleven characteristics of effective security governance are critical for an effective enterprise information security information program.

They are:

1. It is an institution-wide issue
2. Leaders are accountable
3. It is viewed as an institutional requirement (cost of doing business)
4. It is risk-based
5. Roles, responsibilities, and segregation of duties are defined
6. It is addressed and enforced in policy
7. Adequate resources are committed
8. Staff are aware and trained
9. A development life cycle is required
10. It is planned, managed, measureable, and measured
11. It is reviewed and audited

some excellent comparisons of effective and ineffective governance characteristics from the CERT GES

The following principles describe preferred behavior to guide governance decision making

* **Responsibility:** Individuals and groups within the organization understand and accept their responsibilities in respect of both the supply of, and demand for IT. Those with responsibility for actions also have the authority to perform those actions.
* **Strategy:** The organization's business strategy takes into account the current and future capabilities of IT; the strategic plans for IT satisfy the current and ongoing needs of the organization's business strategy.
* **Acquisition:** IT acquisitions are made for valid reasons, on the basis of appropriate and ongoing analysis, with clear and transparent decision-making. There is an appropriate balance between benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks, in both the short term and the long term.
* **Performance:** IT is fit for purpose in supporting the organization, providing the services, levels of service, and service quality required to meet current and future business requirements.
* **Conformance:** IT complies with all mandatory legislation and regulations. Policies and practices are clearly defined, implemented, and enforced.
* **Human Behavior:** IT policies, practices, and decisions demonstrate respect for Human Behavior, including the current and evolving needs of all the 'people in the process'.

Listed below are challenges of ineffective governance \[1]. These challenges can be very useful in presenting rationale to leadership for implementing an effective institution security governance model.

1. Understanding the implications of ubiquitous access and distributed information
2. Appreciating the institution-wide nature of the security problem
3. Overcoming the lack of a game plan
4. Establishing the proper institutional structure and segregation of duties
5. Understanding complex global legal compliance requirements and liability risks (the word global may or may not apply to education)
6. Assessing security risks and the magnitude of harm to the institution
7. Determining and justifying appropriate levels of resources and investment
8. Dealing with the intangible nature of security
9. Reconciling inconsistent deployment of security best practices and standards
10. Overcoming difficulties in creating and sustaining a security-aware culture

Outcomes of effective information security governance should include:

* Strategic alignment of information security with institutional objectives
* Risk management - identify, manage, and mitigate risks
* Resource management
* Performance measurement - defining, reporting, and using information security governance metrics
* Value delivery by optimizing information security investment

**Defining the Information Security Program (so as to define what needs to be governed)**

Activities of an information security program directly support/trace to an institutional risk management plan. In other words, the information security program is targeted to managing institutional risk.

An effective information security program requires the development and maintenance of:

1. A long-term information security strategy
2. An overarching institutional security plan (which may be supported by underlying academic/administrative unit security plans and security plans for individual systems)
3. Security policies, procedures, and other artifacts
4. The system architecture and supporting documentation

Information Security Program hierarchical relationships

* Institutional Risk Management Plan is supported by
* Institutional Security Strategy is supported by
* Institutional Security Plan is supported by
* Academic and administrative unit security plans
* System security plans
* Policies and procedures
* System architecture

Some colleges and universities employ risk managers and some do not. Of those institutions that do employ a risk manager, there are few that appear to have an institution-level risk management plan.The reference to an information security program serving as a business plan for securing digital assets is a simple yet effective communication technique.

**Information Security Governance Best Practices**

* Information security activities should be governed based on relevant requirements, including laws, regulations, and organizational policies.
* Senior managers should be actively involved in establishing information security governance framework and the act of governing the agency's implementation of information security.\
  Information security responsibilities must be assigned and carried out by appropriately trained individuals.
* Individuals responsible for information security within the agency should be held accountable for their actions or lack of actions.
* Information security priorities should be communicated to stakeholders of all levels within an organization to ensure a successful implementation of an information security program.
* Information security activities must be integrated into other management activities of the enterprise, including strategic planning, capital planning, and enterprise architecture.
* Information security organization structure should be appropriate for the organization it supports and should evolve with the organization, if the organization undergoes change.
* Information security managers should continuously monitor the performance of the security program/effort for which they are responsible, using available tools and information.
* Information discovered through monitoring should be used as an input into management decisions about priorities and funding allocation to effect the improvement of security posture and the overall performance of the organization.

### Why is Infosec Governance needed? <a href="#_tvrrs1q5empx" id="_tvrrs1q5empx"></a>

**Why is IT governance important**

* Financial payoffs
* IT is expensive
* IT is pervasive
* New technologies
* IT governance is critical to learning about IT value
* Not just technical - integration and buy-in from business leaders is needed for success
* Senior executives have limited bandwidth, especially at large institutions, so they can't do it all
* Governance patterns depend on desired behaviors
* Profit - centralized to promote sharing, reuse and efficient asset utilization
* Top revenue growth - decentralized to promote customer responsiveness and innovation
* Multiple performance goals - blended centralized and decentralized governance

**Directors could be held accountable for breaches of:**

* security standards;
* privacy legislation;
* spam legislation;
* trade practices legislation;
* intellectual property rights, including software licensing agreements;
* record keeping requirements;
* environmental legislation and regulations;
* health and safety legislation;
* accessibility legislation;
* social responsibility standards.

**Benefits of information security governance**

* Increased predictability and reduced uncertainty of business operations
* Protection from the potential for civil and legal liability
* Structure to optimize the allocation of resources
* Assurance of security policy compliance
* Foundation for effective risk management.
* A level of assurance that critical decisions are not based on faulty information
* Accountability for safeguarding information

**Question to engage institutional leaders**

Thought provoking questions that institutional leaders can ask (and should be able to answer) to determine the state of their security governance efforts.

**Questions to uncover information security issues**

* Does the head of security/CISO routinely meet or brief institutional leaders?
* When was the last time top managers got involved in security-related decisions?
* Do managers know who is responsible for security?
* Would people recognize a security incident? Would they know who

**Questions to find out how managers addresses information security issues**

*
  * Is the institution clear on its position relative to IT and security risks?
  * How much is spent on information security?
  * What percentage of staff had security training last year?

**Questions to assess information security governance practices**

* Are managers confident that security is being adequately addressed in the enterprise?
* Are managers aware of the latest information security issues and best practices?
* Does the institution participate in an incident, threat, vulnerability notification and sharing service?
* What is the industry best practice and how does the institution compare?
* What can be done to successfully implement information security governance?

**Questions individuals responsible for governance should ask and be able to answer.**

**Questions for directors/trustees**

*
  1. Does the board understand the institution's dependence on information?
  2. Does the institution recognize the value and importance of information?
  3. Does the institution have a security strategy?
  4. Does the board understand the institution's potential liabilities in the event of regulatory non-compliance?

**Questions for managers**

*
  1. How is the board kept informed of information security issues? When was the last briefing made to the board on security risks and status of security improvements?
  2. Has someone been appointed to be responsible for developing, implementing and managing the information security program, and is he/she held accountable?
  3. Are security roles and responsibilities clearly defined and communicated?
  4. Is there a CISO or other officer with sufficient authority and resources to accomplish security objectives?

### How to Govern Information Security. <a href="#_vfd0hcvil257" id="_vfd0hcvil257"></a>

The ISO position is evolving from a primary technical position to one that combines both technical and managerial functions. Today IT security is an institutional imperative with critical policy and operational aspects with attention dedicated from the CIO, general counsel, internal auditor and executive leadership. While the list of tasks for the ISO continues to grow, unfortunately the authority and challenges to that authority of the role are often institutionally handled with senior administrators, legal counsel or law enforcement. The ISO must rely on institutional policy and legal compliance in order to effectively control IT security. Building a relationship and consensus with many groups on campus is a key to having security policy compliance. One progressive step is the growing recognition of department managers to accept responsibility for their data and its protection. Shifting the role of the ISO from compliance dictator to offering assistance realizes the concept of security as a service.

The ISO position is limited usually where the number of staff positions limits the ability to assign exclusive roles to individuals and thus dedicating a single entity to enterprise-wide information security. Larger organizations, usually with enrollments over 8,000, recognize security as a top administrative concern and have either created an ISO position or delegated this responsibility to the CIO. However the shift from security being IT's responsibility to being everyone's responsibility seems to have a greater impact on whether an appointment has been given those specific objectives. The identification of the responsibility is clear; less clear is the manner in which it should be addressed. As this profession gradually changes and increases in visibility (unfortunately through continued breaches, incidents and responses), the need for individuals with the experience of managing these episodes will evidence themselves. As the number of skilled professionals entering this field multiplies, the hope is that the role will be better defined with the proper authority given.

Governance frameworks, COBIT, ITIL, the ISO 17799 information security management standard, and the ISO 9000 quality management standard - are used in the IT governance processes and structures. ITIL and ISO 17799 are the most common frameworks in use.

**Organizational Structure**

Unplanned and uncoordinated localization of authority poses great challenges for institution-wide compliance with security, copyright, privacy, identity and other regulation. It makes it awkward for CIOs to account well for the breadth and depth of overall IT activity, and it can be inefficient. Localization of authority in some areas is critical. The question is not "to centralize or not to decentralize" but where to centralize (or not) and how to harmonize institutional efforts and investments in IT.

IT governance-related committees include:

*
  1. Top-level IT steering committee for oversight of major IT policies and initiatives
  2. IT advisory committees for administration and teaching and learning
  3. IT initiative specific committees for items like enterprise resource planning, security or business continuity

**Governance structures depend on desired outcomes**

CERT GES desribes structure based on desired outcomes.

* Top revenue growth - decentralized to promote customer responsiveness and innovation
* Profit - centralized to promote sharing, reuse and efficient asset utilization
* Multiple performance goals - blended centralized and decentralized

**Information Security Governance Structures**

The NIST Security Handbook states that governance is highly dependent on the overall organization structure.

* Centralized maintain budget control and ensure implementation and monitoring of information security controls.
* Decentralized have policy and oversight responsibilities and budget responsibilities for their departmental security program not the operating unit information security program. Reporting structures are different as well.
* Governance structures can be hybrid, with a combination of characteristics from both centralized and decentralized.

**Political Archetypes**

Weill and Ross use political archetypes in _IT Governance_ to describes people or groups who have decision rights.

* **Business monarchy:** Senior business executives make IT decisions
* **IT monarchy:** IT executives make IT decisions
* **Feudal:** Business unit leaders make IT decisions to optimize local needs, but does not facilitate enterprise decision-making.
* **Federal:** Coordinated IT decision-making between the center and the business units.
* **IT duopoly**: IT executives and one other group (such as senior executives or business units) make IT decisions.
* **Anarchy:** Individual users or small groups make IT decisions Anarchy is expensive, difficult to support and rare, but sometimes used when very rapid customer responsiveness is needed.

**What Governance Arrangements Work Best**

* Monarchies work well when profit is a priority.
* Feudal or business monarchy arrangements might work best when growth is a priority.
* Federal arrangements can work well for input into all IT decisions. Avoid federal arrangement for all decisions since it's difficult to balance the center with the business unit needs.
* Duopoly arrangements work well for IT principles, investment decisions and business application needs. Duopolies also work best when asset utilization is a priority.

**Roles and Responsibilities**

The ISO or CISO is an emerging profession with highly-motivated individuals seeking their own professional development through membership in organizations, participation in training where they can find it and constant sharing of ideas and advice with others both internally and externally to their organization. There does not seem to be a clearly defined path for this new subfield within IT. The vast majority of those in an ISO/CISO position held previous positions in IT and came from higher education backgrounds. Institutions appear to be recruiting security officers from IT managerial ranks. Often these folks started with very strong technical experience and have now developed skills in business process analysis, thus moving away from hands-on activities.

In addition to certifications, ISOs find the following "soft skills" beneficial.

* Reputation building
* Campus-wide coordination and communication
* Collaboration
* Campus-wide profiles

These soft skills are critical for effective engagement with diverse campus audiences.

* Senior leader of the institution
* Deans, Department Chairs and Directors
* IT managers
* Auditors
* Attorneys
* Human Resources
* Faculty
* Staff
* Students

Primary ISO responsibilities

* Development and enforcement of security policies and procedures
* Risk management
* Security awareness program
* Incident management and forensics
* Business continuity
* Disaster recovery

Supportive functions of an ISO

* Application and system security
* Network security
* Access control
* Authentication and authorization
* Identity management

**Decision-Making Structures**

Weill and Ross describe organizational units and roles responsible for making IT decisions, such as committees, executive teams, and business/IT relationship managers.

* Executive or senior management committees
* IT leadership committee
* Process teams with IT members
* Business/IT relationship managers
* IT council of IT and business executives
* Architecture committee
* Capital improvement committee

**Who should be concerned with information security governance?**

* Board of directors/trustees - The board has fundamental responsibility to protect the interests of the organization.
* Executives - This group develops strategies and ensures integration with and cooperation of business unit managers and process owners
* Steering committee - This group includes representation across the organization and is responsible for ensuring that stakeholders concerns are addressed.
* CISO

**What should the board of directors/trustees and senior executives be doing?**

* Understand why information security needs to be governed
  * Address risks and threats
  * Protect the organization's reputation
  * Ensure coordination and cooperation among business units
  * Take board level action
  * Become informed about information security
  * Set direction (e.g., drive policy and strategy)
  * Provide resources
  * Assign responsibilities
  * Set priorities
* Take senior level action
  * Provide oversight for the development of a security framework
  * Policy development
  * Assign roles and responsibilities
  * Implement
  * Monitor
  * Ensure awareness and training

**Roles and Responsibilities for an Institution-Wide Security Program**

The CERT framework assumes a board risk committee (or equivalent) at the highest governance level.

There are nine groups of personnel involved in developing and sustaining an effective institution-wide security program.

1. Board risk committee
2. Senior officers of the institution: chief officers such as Chief Executive Officer (CEO)/President and Chief Operating Officer (COO)/Provost
3. ross-organizational security steering council comprised of:
   1. General Counsel
   2. Chief Information Officer
   3. Chief Security Officer and/or Chief Risk Officer
   4. Chief Privacy Officer
   5. Chief Financial Officer
   6. Deans/academic unit executives and/or other unit executives
   7. Communications executives/public relations
   8. Director of Human resources
4. set owners
5. Business managers
6. Operational personnel, including procurement
7. Certification agent
8. Board audit committee
9. Internal and external audit personnel

### Information Security Governance Framework <a href="#_w2llbxv7d1zz" id="_w2llbxv7d1zz"></a>

The first to admit that buzzwords like “information security governance,” “cyber security organizational structure,” and “information security organizational structure” can sound like trendy but otherwise meaningless concepts. What information security governance is in a way that helps you not only understand the goals of information security governance, but how it can help you address and align the various compliance requirements your organization may be subject to. This article will discuss IT compliance requirements and how implementing an information security governance model can help you meet your requirements through IT and cybersecurity compliance frameworks in a more streamlined and efficient manner.

### Why is Information Security Governance Important? <a href="#_ro0rbj1kawq5" id="_ro0rbj1kawq5"></a>

Businesses have competing objectives and priorities. Sales and revenue, profit margins, and client satisfaction should land at the top of the list of any organization’s priorities. However, in today’s world of increased reliance on information technology, you compromise each of those priorities if information security is not integrated into every aspect of your business, embedded in every conversation, and considered a key component of your business and product strategy. Enter information security governance. If you want to be able to compete in today’s technology-focused world, you need an information security governance framework, if for no other reason than to mitigate the risk of being in the news about the next data breach.

In addition to an organization’s priorities to keep the lights on, businesses often have competing compliance requirements. Many of our clients come to us because they need a SOC 2 report – either to satisfy a contractual obligation or to better position themselves in the marketplace. After the first year, it is not uncommon for our clients to start asking how they can also satisfy other IT compliance requirements their clients are asking about. As more companies outsource services and technology, the need for increased compliance and proof of that compliance also increases. The requirements run the gamut, but HIPAA, HITRUST, and GDPR tend to top the list. As an independent auditor, we are able to issue different compliance attestation reports to help our clients demonstrate their compliance with the different, but similar, IT and cybersecurity compliance requirements.

### Benefits of Information Security Governance <a href="#_n4lcy9xsxqw9" id="_n4lcy9xsxqw9"></a>

Many of the new concerned companies are the start-ups that know information security is important, but couldn’t define an IT control to save their life – they’re too focused on trying to get their innovative product off the ground, and make a few dollars along the way. Some of other companies have been in business for quite some time, but have been patching together IT security controls to meet different requirements over time and are left with competing priorities, redundancies, and inefficiencies across their internal controls.

The benefits of information security governance are that it helps to align priorities, eliminate redundancies, and reduce inefficiencies. When implemented correctly, an information security governance framework takes into consideration a company’s strategy, operations, and compliance requirements, and provides a structure to manage the objectives of each in a balanced and organized manner.

### How to Build An Information Security Governance Framework <a href="#_4i0wf0uso8bt" id="_4i0wf0uso8bt"></a>

First and foremost, you need to identify the compliance, regulatory, and contractual requirements your company is subject to. To start, here are some good questions to ask:

*
  1. Did we sign a contract with a new client promising to deliver a SOC 2 report by year-end?
  2. Do we process and/or store electronic protected health information (ePHI)?
  3. Do we do business in the European Union or offer goods or services to individuals or businesses in the EU? What about California?
  4. Are we trying to win a Federal government contract?
  5. Are we a public company? Do we process financial transactions on behalf of our clients?
  6. Are one or more of our clients asking if we have ISO 27001 certification?

The way you answer these questions helps you identify the various IT compliance frameworks you may be subject to. For example, if you process and/or store ePHI, you may be required to demonstrate your compliance with HIPAA or HITRUST. If you are looking to enter the Federal contracting space, you should research whether you will be subject to FEDRAMP, CMMC, one of the NIST frameworks.

Once you have identified your requirements, you can select the appropriate framework or frameworks that will help you meet your IT compliance objectives. The IT compliance standards that you are subject to can serve as the basis for your information security governance framework. Each IT compliance standard will help you identify the minimum standards you are required to meet through your information security policies and IT controls, and in turn, helps to define those policies and controls. If you are subject to multiple IT compliance standards, further analysis is required to understand how you can design your information security governance framework to bring together common requirements under multiple compliance requirements, while ensuring the unique requirements of each are also met.

### Example of Information Governance <a href="#_nmconjdis4gm" id="_nmconjdis4gm"></a>

Going back to our SOC 2 vs. HIPAA example, consider the requirements for information system authentication under each standard, and compare to authentication requirements under PCI, which is an IT compliance framework designed specifically for entities that process and store credit card data:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/1 (1)>)

The requirements are written differently, but all address a similar objective to verify that a user accessing a system is properly authenticated. As you can see, the requirements under SOC 2 and HIPAA are more generally stated, while the requirements under PCI are more specific. If your organization is required to be compliant with each of these frameworks, your information security governance model would consider the requirements under each standard and establish a policy around user authentication that requires the most specific elements to be met. Similarly, you would then implement a control around user authentication that requires a unique user ID, password, and multifactor authentication, so that all frameworks are met using the most stringent criteria, rather than implementing three separate controls aligned to each framework.

If you are just starting out on your IT compliance journey, SOC 2 is a good place to start. It is a comprehensive, but flexible, framework. It is less rigid than other frameworks, which allows you to self-define controls that meet the Trust Services Criteria. You can then design your SOC 2 policies and controls in a way that allows you to incorporate other IT compliance standards as needed.

Note that this is where hiring a dedicated security/compliance resource or external consultant may be beneficial. It’s not uncommon for us to see our clients bootstrap security and compliance for the first year or two, but the reality is that as you grow, your IT compliance requirements are also likely to grow and become more complex, so experts in this field can be a valuable asset to your company. Alternatively, implementing a governance, risk, and compliance tool may be beneficial.

### Why Do You Need An Information Security Governance Framework <a href="#_y77sjxvpj4rn" id="_y77sjxvpj4rn"></a>

**(**[Cyber Security Management: Trim, Peter - Books](https://www.amazon.com/Cyber-Security-Management-Peter-Trim/dp/036760616X/ref=sr\_1\_6?crid=2PQP93D2I8IQR\&keywords=information+security+and+GRC\&qid=1649738350\&s=books\&sprefix=information+security+and+grc%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C262\&sr=1-6\&asin=036760616X\&revisionId=\&format=4\&depth=1)**)**

It’s important to remember that the goals of your information security governance framework should be to not only help you meet your IT compliance obligations, but to do so in the most efficient way. When IT compliance requirements are addressed in an ad hoc manner, redundancy is bound to result, as is inefficiency and the opportunity for missed requirements. Taking a holistic, top-down approach will help you to effectively manage IT compliance within your organization.
