### Career Counseling: An Overview <a href="#_pbfij1i142c2" id="_pbfij1i142c2"></a>

**(**[Career Counseling: Holism, Diversity, and Strengths 4th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Career-Counseling-Holism-Diversity-Strengths/dp/1556203330/ref=sr\_1\_3?keywords=career+counseling\&qid=1649997083\&s=books\&sprefix=career+co%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C509\&sr=1-3) **)**

As individuals, our careers are shaped by the choices and actions we take throughout our lives. These careers are not just limited to our professional pursuits, but also encompass the various roles we play in our personal lives. Managing our careers effectively requires a balance between all of these roles, as they work together to create the overall direction and purpose of our lives.

In a sense, career development is a process of self-discovery, as we continually seek to understand ourselves and make sense of our experiences. It is a journey of personal growth and fulfillment, as we strive to make the most of our time on earth by pursuing meaningful and fulfilling work. By taking an active role in shaping our careers, we can create a sense of purpose and direction in our lives, and find fulfillment and satisfaction in the work we do.

The theory and research base of career development and the practice of career counseling has evolved and changed as the 21st century has continued to unfold. Modern normative, science-based theories such as Holland’s theory of vocational personalities and work environments continue to be useful in guiding the practice of career counseling (R. W. Lent, 2013).&#x20;

At the same time, there has been “a proliferation of career counseling approaches underpinned by postmodern and constructivist philosophies” (McMahon, Watson, Chetty, & Hoelson, 2012, p. 127).

The integration of modern and postmodern theories is leading to a renewed examination of career development and the practices used in career counseling. This fresh perspective is also prompting new approaches to gathering client information and forming hypotheses about their behavior and goals. These advances are helping career counselors select more effective interventions to assist clients in achieving their objectives and resolving any issues they may be facing.

This shift towards a more holistic and flexible approach to career counseling allows for a greater understanding of the complex and multi-faceted nature of career development. It recognizes that individuals are not defined solely by their career choices, but rather by the many roles and experiences that make up their lives. By taking this broader view, career counselors can more effectively support clients as they navigate their own unique path towards personal and professional growth.

To set the stage for the rest of the book, the first part of Chapter 1 examines the nature and structure of career counseling in light of the changes occurring in career development theory building. This discussion is presented to provide a perspective and an organizer for the career counseling interventions that are described in the chapters that follow.

Then, in the second part of Chapter 1, a holistic view of career development, called life career development, is described to provide a conceptual foundation and point of departure for career counseling with clients of all ages and circumstances.

**Career Counseling**

What is career counseling? Is it different from other forms of counseling? Is it the same? Is there overlap? These questions are being asked with increasing frequency today as attempts are being made to clarify this form of counseling (Amundson, Harris-Bowlsbey, & Niles, 2009; Capuzzi & Stauffer, 2012; Savickas, 2011).

The main focus of the current debate surrounding career counseling centers around two main points. The first is the fundamental nature of career counseling - what are its inherent characteristics and qualities? Does it involve psychological processes? The second point of discussion is the structure of career counseling - is there a specific structure in place? If so, what is the organization, sequence, and connections between the different stages and sub-phases involved?

**The Nature of Career Counseling**

“Historically, career and vocational counseling have served as the cornerstones upon which the counseling profession was built” (Dorn, 1992, p. 176). Unfortunately, along the path of history, career counseling became stereotyped. In many people’s minds it became time limited, it was devoid of psychological processes, and it focused on outcomes and methods (Osipow, 1982). Swanson (1995), paraphrasing the work of Manuel Adkins, underscored this point:

Manuele-Adkins (1992) described elements of a stereotypic view of career counseling that discredit its psychological component and affect the quality and delivery of career counseling services. In this stereotypic view, career counseling is a rational process, with an emphasis on information-giving, testing, and computer-based systems; it is short-term, thus limiting the range of possible intervention strategies and obscuring psychological processes such as indecision; and it is different from personal counseling, thus lowering the perceived value of career counseling and increasing a false separation between work and nonwork. (p. 222)

Young and Domene (2012) added to this historical debate by stating there is still a disconnect between career counseling and counseling for other areas of life, such as family, emotional difficulties and relationship issues” (p. 16). It has been noted that practitioners in career counseling and counseling in general often have distinct professional identities, practices, and professional associations, which contributes to a separation between the two fields. This can lead to a lack of communication and access to each other's professional literature.

Furthermore, it is believed that this divide has caused the general public to develop misconceptions about the nature of career counseling.&#x20;

There are several myths and misconceptions about career counseling that are important to address:

1.Career counselors can use standardized assessments to determine the best occupation for a person.

2\. Work role decisions can be made independently of other life roles.&#x20;

3\. Career counseling does not address personal issues.

4\. Career counselors do not need extensive counseling skills to be competent.&#x20;

5\. Career counseling does not consider the client's context and culture.

6\. Career counseling is only necessary when making a career decision.

7\. Career counseling ends once a career decision has been made.&#x20;

It is important to recognize that these statements are not accurate and that career counseling involves a more comprehensive approach that takes into account the individual's unique needs, goals, and circumstances.

Contrary to popular belief, career counseling should be considered a form of counseling because it shares the same essential characteristics and qualities as other types of counseling. However, career counseling may differ in that the concerns and issues brought up by clients often center around work and career matters, and there is a greater use of quantitative and qualitative assessment procedures and information. Swanson (1995) suggested this characterization of career counseling when she defined it as “an ongoing, face-to-face interaction between counselor and client, with the primary focus on work- or career-related issues; the interaction is psychological in nature, with the relationship between counselor and client serving an important function”.

As practitioners of counseling know, the initial issues presented by clients are often just the tip of the iceberg. As counseling progresses, other problems may come to the surface. Career issues can frequently intersect with personal and emotional issues and family issues, and may also loop back to career issues again. Counseling involves a holistic approach that considers the individual's various concerns and works towards a resolution. (Andersen & Vandehey, 2012). Thoughts, emotions, and feelings are all involved.

Emotion has the potential to provide insights into the motivations behind vocational behavior. It may be beneficial to examine the role of emotion in career theory and practice more broadly, and specifically in relation to goal-directedness, purpose, meaning, narrative, and intentionality in career planning. Emotion can play a significant role in how individuals approach their careers and make decisions about their professional paths.

The need to address client concerns related to work and career issues, which require specific theoretical frameworks and interventions grounded in career development theory, research, and practice, is another important reason to continue using the term "career counseling." These frameworks and interventions are often not found in the literature related to other forms of counseling. Similarly, theoretical frameworks and interventions that come from a personal and emotional counseling perspective are not typically found in the literature on career counseling. It is important for practitioners to be aware of and utilize appropriate theories and interventions for the specific issues being addressed. According to Collin (2006),

Careers involve both objective and subjective elements, as they involve both the external realities of work and the individual's personal experience of it. Even when the focus is on objective elements, subjective elements are always present. Careers also involve other dualities such as the individual and the collective, and rhetoric and praxis. The inherent ambivalence of careers, with their "both/and" nature rather than "either/or," makes them a powerful and fascinating concept that can continue to provide meaning in the 21st century.&#x20;

Our starting point should be our clients, not predetermined distinctions of counseling. Zunker (2002) made this same point when he stated, “We are not just career counselors, we counsel individuals” (p. 7). The emphasis on client problems to guide and work with clients was suggested by Blustein and Spengler (1995) in their domain-sensitive approach:

A domain-sensitive approach refers to a way of intervening with clients such that the full array of human experiences is encompassed. The goals of such an intervention are to improve adjustment and facilitate developmental progress in both the career and non career domains. The term domain pertains to the scope of the client’s psychological experiences, encompassing both career and non career settings. By following domain with the term sensitive, we are attempting to capture counselors’ inherent openness, empathy, and interest with respect to both the career and non career domains and their ability to shift between these content domains effectively. In effect, a domain-sensitive approach is characterized by the counselor’s concerted interest in and awareness of all possible ramifications of a client’s psychological experience and its behavioral expressions. In this approach, the counselor clearly values the client’s experiences in both the career and non career domains. The counselor bases a decision about where to intervene on informed judgments about where the problem originated and where it is most accessible for intervention. (p. 317)

In the domain-sensitive approach, the career problems clients have are not automatically converted to personal–emotional problems because career (work) issues require full attention in the career counseling process (Blustein, 2006). Nor are personal– emotional problems automatically converted to career problems.

“The underlying asset of a domain-sensitive approach is that interventions are not based on discrete or arbitrary distinctions between treatment modalities but are determined by the unique attributes of each client’s history and presenting problem” (Blustein & Spengler, 1995, p. 318). The terms career counseling and personal–emotional counseling should remain as ways to organize theory and research but not as ways to restrict our view of clients and limit our work with them. Many years ago, Super (1955) stated it this way: “One counsels people rather than problems” (p. 4).

**The Structure of Career Counseling**

Now that we have discussed the nature of career counseling, it is important to consider how to organize the work of clients and counselors in career counseling. One possibility is to structure the work into phases and subphases. If this is done, it is important to consider the arrangement and sequence of the phases and subphases, as well as how they are interconnected. Many authors have suggested ways to structure career counseling, including Parsons (1909), Amundson et al. (2009), Crites (1981), Kidd (2004), McDaniels & Gysbers (1992), and Savickas (2011).

For the purposes of this book, the authors suggest a structure for career counseling that includes two major phases (Client Goal or Problem Identification, Clarification, and Specification and Client Goal or Problem Resolution) and several subphases.

We see the working alliance evolving during career counseling—moving from forming the working alliance, to strengthening it, to fulfilling it, to finally closing it upon completion of career counseling. How important is a good relationship? Amundson (2006) stated it this way:

“All counseling interventions are dependent on the foundation of a good relationship”

It is important to note that all of the phases and subphases of career counseling may not necessarily occur within a single session. It is more likely that they will unfold over multiple sessions. In some cases, policies at agencies or institutions may limit the number of sessions available. In these cases, it is important for clients and counselors to understand the time constraints and make informed decisions about what can be achieved within the allotted time.

It is possible that there may be unfinished business when the counseling relationship ends in situations where the allotted time is insufficient to complete the full counseling process. Additionally, it is important to note that the suggested phases and subphases of career counseling may not always progress in a linear fashion in practice. It may be necessary to revisit earlier phases or subphases before moving forward again. For example, a client may reach the "taking action" subphase only to realize that additional interventions are needed, which necessitates returning to the "gathering client information" subphase. This back-and-forth flow is a normal part of the counseling process and allows the counselor to address the client's needs and concerns in a comprehensive and holistic manner. To picture this point, you can see that the phases and subphases of career counseling presented in linear outline form in Table 1-1 are placed in a circular format in Figure 1-1. Note how the working alliance evolves and interacts with the phases and subphases and how central it is to the structure of career counseling.&#x20;

It is important to remember that not all clients who seek help want or need to go through the full career counseling process. Some may only need limited assistance, while others may need to be involved in the full process over time but may be resistant to this. Dealing with resistance may be a priority in the initial stages of forming the working alliance. However, it is important to be aware that resistance may reoccur throughout the counseling process as clients struggle with their problems. Dealing with recurring resistance is an important part of the psychological processes involved in career counseling. It is important for the counselor to work with the client to address and resolve any resistance that may arise.

### <mark style="color:purple;">Ethics for Career Counseling.</mark> <a href="#_daok1e664b1i" id="_daok1e664b1i"></a>

**(** [Amazon.com: Career Theory and Practice: Learning Through Case Studies: 9781544333663](https://www.amazon.com/Career-Theory-Practice-Learning-Through/dp/1544333668/ref=sr\_1\_29?crid=16QG3MXF065YJ\&keywords=career\&qid=1649315916\&s=books\&sprefix=care%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C1014\&sr=1-29) **)**

Most professional associations endorse a code of ethics that guides the ethical behavior of their members. In many cases, the code of ethics identifies the central values that undergird the profession. For example, the American Counseling Association (2014) code of ethics outlines the principles of enhancing human development throughout the lifespan; honoring diversity and embracing a multicultural approach in support of the worth, dignity, potential, and uniqueness of people within their social and cultural contexts; promoting social justice; safeguarding the integrity of the counselor–client relationship; and practicing in a competent and ethical manner. The ACA Code notes that these principles are the foundation for the ethical behavior and guiding values for counselors of autonomy, or fostering the right to control the direction of one’s life; nonmaleficence, or avoiding actions that cause harm and beneficence, or working for the good of the individual and society by promoting mental health and well-being; justice, or treating individuals equitably and fostering fairness and equality; fidelity, or honoring commitments and keeping promises, including fulfilling one’s responsibilities of trust in professional relationships; and veracity, or dealing truthfully with individuals with whom counselors come into professional contact.

In other words, counselors work to not harm their clients but do work to benefit their clients. Counselors treat clients fairly, honor their obligations, fulfill their responsibilities and are honest. These principles form the foundation of counselors’ effective work with clients.

Career counselors are ethically bound to follow the 2014 ethical guidelines of the American Counseling Association (found at www.counseling.org), and we encourage readers to consult these guidelines for further information. Career counselors also are bound to follow the 2015 ethics code of the National Career Development Association; this chapter will focus on the NCDA ethics code. As the NCDA code states,

“A code of ethics helps to define professional behavior and serves to protect the public, the profession, and those who practice within the profession” (p.1).

It helps to guide the appropriate decisions and actions to take with a client. The Code helps to answer when to keep a client’s confidence, what to do when a client is also seeing another therapist, how to manage challenges when working online, or how to appropriately use and interpret a career assessment.

**The National Career Development Association NCDA (2015) Code of Ethics**

The NCDA (2015) has designed 9 Codes of Ethics, that are as follows:

1. **The Professional Relationship**

Section A guides practitioners in all aspects of the professional relationship between career professionals and clients. A.1 focuses on the core aspects of working directly with “individuals to whom they provide services” (p. 3). This includes the importance of “doing good” and putting the welfare of the client first (A.1a), and outlines the types of services a career professional might use (planning vs. counseling) (A.1.b), also noting that practitioners provide only those services for which they are competent (competence is further discussed in Guideline C.2). Career professionals must carefully document the services and actions taken with clients and follow all applicable state and federal laws and regulations related to record-keeping (A.1.c). This includes carefully documenting amendments to documents, as well as knowing when documents should be purged. Career professionals are encouraged to work together with clients in forming and reviewing plans for services (A.1.d), and are encouraged to enlist individuals in the client’s social network on his or her behalf (with client consent) (A.1.e).

A.2 addresses aspects of informed consent, which is the right of the client to have enough information to choose whether to engage in a professional relationship with a career practitioner. Practitioners must review, both verbally and in writing, the rights and responsibilities of the practitioner and client, and practitioners have an obligation to periodically review informed consent throughout services. A.2.b outlines information that should be in the informed consent, including types and length of services, billing, potential use of technology, and what might happen if the career professional were to be incapacitated. Client rights are also outlined in A.2.b, which include the right to confidentiality (and any limits), the right to know the information that is included in records, the right to participate in service planning, and the right to refuse services (and to be advised of the consequences of such refusal). Embedded throughout the entire code is the importance of cultural sensitivity, and in A.2, this is highlighted in communicating informed consent. The Code also addresses special cases of informed consent, such as for minors (A.2.d), or for clients mandated for services (A.2.e). The Code notes that minors, or others not able to give voluntary consent, still have the right to give assent to services. The guideline highlights the need for practitioners to balance clients’ rights to make choices that affect their lives with the responsibilities of families to act on behalf of their children. When working with clients who have been mandated for services, practitioners explain the services that will be provided, as well as what information will be shared about the outcome of services. Clients have the right to refuse services in this case, but practitioners have an obligation to review the consequences of such refusal.

Sections A.3 addresses situations that often occur for career professionals, who may find out their expertise is solicited by clients working with other professionals. If this happens, practitioners seek a written release from clients to inform the other professionals. Career professionals must avoid harming clients, students, or research participants and are aware of their biases to avoid imposing values on their clients. (A.4.a and A.4.b).

Section A.5 addresses aspects of roles and relationships with clients, some of which are prohibited, while others are discouraged. In general, career professionals should be aware of the potential for abuse of power when forming multiple roles with current or former clients. For example, sexual or romantic relationships are prohibited with current clients, their romantic partners, or their family members (A.5.a). Sexual or romantic relationships are also prohibited with former clients, their romantic partners, or their family members for at least 5 years (or a longer period as specified by state or federal law) (A.5.b). Career professionals are encouraged to avoid nonprofessional relationships with clients, their romantic partners, or family members (A.5.c). But, in the event such interaction might be beneficial (e.g., going to a wedding or graduation), professionals carefully document the interaction and benefit, as well as evidence of client consent (A.5.d). If the professional’s role changes (e.g., from individual to family counseling), clients are informed of the consequences of the role change (A.5.e). Career professionals are encouraged not to provide services to their own previous romantic partners or family members. If they do so, they are encouraged to seek consultation from another professional (A.5.f).

Career professionals are encouraged to advocate at all levels (individual to societal) to examine and dismantle barriers for clients, with the consent of the client (A.6). If a career professional agrees to provide services to two or more persons, A.7 helps to identify steps to take to ensure that clients are not harmed, including clarifying the relationships and the need to withdraw from one or more of the services if the roles conflict. Career professionals who provide group services have additional steps to take to ensure client welfare, including the need to screen clients to ensure their needs are compatible with the level of service provided in the group (A.8.a) and the need to protect clients from harm (A.8.b).

Guideline A.9 addresses fees and business practices, including not referring clients to their own private practice (unless the organization has policies that allow it), and making sure that fees are reasonable for their location and the client’s financial status (A.9.a and A.9.b). If professionals have policies to take legal action to collect fees, this must be in their informed consent documents, and they must offer clients the opportunity to make payment (A.9.c). Career professionals are encouraged to refrain from bartering with clients, or exchanging their services for a service provided by the client. Bartering may only be used if it is not exploitive or harmful, if the client requests it, and it is common in the community (A.9.d). Guideline A.9.e addresses when and how to accept gifts, encouraging professionals to take the cultural context of the gesture into account.

The final section of Section A addresses termination of professional services. Career professionals are prohibited from abandoning clients (A.10.a), but if they believe they can no longer be of assistance to clients, they do not continue the relationship (A.10.b), suggesting alternatives or referrals. They are encouraged to terminate the relationship when the client is finished with career plans or is no longer benefiting from the relationship. If a transfer is made, the career professional makes all attempts to maintain an open communication between professionals (A.10.c and A.10.d).

1. **Confidentiality, Privileged Communication, and Privacy**

Section B of the NCDA Ethics Code focuses on the importance of earning and maintaining trust, upholding professional boundaries, and maintaining confidentiality. B.1 emphasizes respecting clients’ rights, including an understanding of cultural meanings of confidentiality, clients’ rights to privacy, and confidentiality (B.1.a through B.1.c) and the need to explain any limits to confidentiality (B.1.d). Guideline B.2 outlines exceptions to confidentiality, or when state and professional standards dictate a need to disclose what a client has said. Specifically, career professionals will disclose confidential information if they need to protect the client or others from harm (such as a threat to harm someone, or disclosure of child or elder abuse). They also are justified in disclosing information about a communicable and life-threatening disease if the third party is identifiable and at high risk of contracting the disease (B.2.a and B.2.b). When career counselors are ordered by a court to release confidential information, they inform the client of the request, obtain written consent to disclose information, and try to prohibit the disclosure, or limit as much as possible the amount of information disclosed to minimize harm to the client (B.2.c). The importance of maintaining confidentiality is extended to subordinates, treatment teams, settings and third-party payers, noting in the latter that clients must authorize disclosure to third-party payers (B.3.a through B.3.d).

Guideline B.4 focuses on confidentiality and privacy in group settings. Career professionals must explain the limits of confidentiality for groups, as well as for multiple family members (B.4.a and B.4.b). In the case of working with multiple members of a family, it is important to consider who is the “client.” It is also important to maintain confidentiality for minor clients or those who cannot give consent, noting the responsibility to minor clients but also to parents and guardians who are responsible for those minors (B.5.b). If confidential information is to be released about someone who cannot give voluntary consent (e.g., a minor), consent must be sought from a responsible third party, such as a parent (B.5.c).

Guideline B.6 addresses matters related to client records, including that documentation is current and records are kept secure (B.6.a). Permission is obtained from clients prior to recording or observing them (B.6.b and B.6.c). Clients have the right to their records and career professionals are encouraged to provide reasonable access to records, including providing assistance in understanding them (B.6.d and B.6.e). Written permission is needed to transfer records to a third party (B.6.f). Records are stored for an appropriate length of time in accordance with state and federal laws, but are then purged (B.6.g). Career professionals are encouraged to take precautions to safeguard a client’s confidentiality if they terminate their own practice, appointing a records custodian (B.6.h).

Guideline B.7 applies to career professionals in the research realm. Researchers must be accurate with their proposals and obtain institutional approval for research, adhere to federal, state, and institutional guidelines regarding research, maintain participant confidentiality and privacy, as well as any limits to confidentiality (B.7.a through B.7.c). Researchers do not disclose information that could lead to participant identification, and if they use quotes that may identify clients or research participants, those individuals must review the material and agree to the presentation (B.7.d and B.7.e).

When acting in a consultant capacity, career professionals discuss confidentiality among the participants in the consultation, as well as the limits of confidentiality, make every effort to protect the privacy of individuals, and do not disclose confidential information that might lead to identification of a client without prior consent (B.8.a through B.8.c).

1. **Professional Responsibility**

Section C of the NCDA Ethics Code focuses on the career professional’s responsibilities, including their responsibility to be competent, to be honest and accurate in advertising, and to be nondiscriminatory in their work.

Career professionals know and comply with the standards and guidelines of the profession (C.1), and are enjoined from practicing outside the boundaries of their competence (C.2.a). Multicultural competence is expected as part of this guideline. When they seek new areas of specialty, career professionals seek appropriate education and/or supervision, and accept as work appointments only positions for which they are qualified (C.2.b and C.2.c.). Along with working within the bounds of competence, career professionals monitor their effectiveness, seeking supervision where necessary and consulting their ethical obligations as appropriate, and seek continuing education to maintain their competence (C.2.d through C.2.f). They are alert to their own impairment and take steps to seek assistance for their own physical and mental health when their impairment might harm clients (C.2.g). Competent career professionals make arrangements in the event that they have to terminate their practice. Similar to B.6.h, the latter includes making a plan for transfer of clients, if necessary, and identifying a records custodian, if they are no longer able to practice due to incapacitation or death.

Guideline C.3 addresses accuracy and honesty in advertising and soliciting clients. Career professionals must be accurate in their advertising, only use testimonials from clients from whom they received permission, and make sure statements made by others about them are accurate (C.3.a through C.3.c). They do not recruit for a private practice through their place of employment, and only promote products accurately and with enough information to allow consumers to make an informed choice (C.3.d and C.3.e). Career professionals do not use their professional activities (consultation, teaching, supervision) to promote products in a deceptive manner (C.3.f).

Guideline C.4 encourages professionals to claim only professional qualifications they have completed and to correct others’ impressions of them (C.4.a). Professionals should claim only their current licenses and the degrees they have earned, state their highest degree earned, and do not use the title “Dr.” if they have not earned a doctorate (C.4.b and C.4.d). They accurately indicate the accreditation status of their educational program at the time they graduated and accurately represent their professional memberships (C.4.e and C.4.f).

Guidelines C.5 and 6 focus on nondiscrimination and public responsibility. C.5 enjoins career professionals from any discrimination on the basis of cultural identity, or discrimination against students, clients, employees or research participants. C.6 stipulates that career professionals do not sexually harass others, are accurate and honest in reports to third parties, are professional in all media presentations, including being consistent with the NCDA Code of Ethics, do not exploit others, base their treatment on current scientific foundations, and make an effort to provide services to the public pro bono (C.6.a through C.6.f). When working with other professionals, C.7 stipulates that career professionals make it clear when their statements are from their own personal perspective, as opposed to speaking for the profession. C.8 encourages career professionals to create policy statements and guidelines to use in their practice.

1. **Relationships With Other Professionals**

Section D addresses two types of relationships with other professionals: D.1 focuses on interdisciplinary work with others, and D.2 on coaching and consultation.

Career professionals are encouraged to respect professionals in other careers, work to develop strong interdisciplinary relationships, work with others to keep the focus on the client, and maintain the client’s confidentiality as much as possible (D.1.a through D.1.d). When part of a team, they work to clarify ethical obligations among team members and, if there is a conflict, work to resolve it within the team (D.1.e). They hire competent staff, and accept employment only in settings that have acceptable standards of conduct (D.1.f and D.1.g). If there are negative conditions, they attempt to effect change within the organization and, if not successful, report to appropriate agencies or organizations who have oversight (D.1.h). They take care not to harass or dismiss an employee who has raised concerns (D.1.i).

When career professionals serve as coaches, they must make sure they have the appropriate competencies for the role, understand the consultee’s context and consequences of interventions, encourage the consultant's growth toward self direction, and insure to provide written informed consent for the consultant's review (D.2.a through D.2.c). In consultation, informed consent includes the definition of the problem, goals for change, and predicted consequences of interventions (D.2.d).

1. **Evaluation, Assessment, and Interpretation**

Section E of the Code focuses on ethical mandates for appropriate assessment. The ACA and NCDA collaborated with other educational professional associations to form the Joint Committee on Testing Practices (JCTP). This group developed the Code of Fair Testing Practices in Education (JCTP, 2004), which outlines the obligations for test users: Test users should administer and score tests correctly and fairly; should report and interpret test results accurately and clearly; and should provide clients with information about the instrument, the use of scores, and where to find more information about the instrument and results.

The NCDA guidelines address the appropriate use of assessment, in large part because unethical assessment practices may lead to significant client harm. Professional ethical codes emphasize that tests must be reliable and valid, that client welfare is paramount in the assessment process (E.1.a and E.1.b), and that counselors need to be competent in the tools that they use (E.2), also understanding the limits of their competence (E.2.a). Assessment tools must be used appropriately, and career professionals must have a thorough understanding of psychometrics and guidelines for assessment use (E.2.b and E.2.c). Career professionals are obligated to explain the nature and purpose of the assessment tools to clients, and consider the client’s welfare in determining who receives results (E.3.a and E.3.b). Career professionals do not release results with identifying information about the client unless the client consents, and then only to people who are qualified to interpret the results (E.4).

There are a number of guidelines related to appropriate diagnosis, recommendations, and choosing instruments (E.5, 6). Assessment techniques should be carefully selected and implemented, and done so with cultural sensitivity (E.5.a and E.5.b). Career professionals must also recognize the potential of historical trauma of assessment with some cultural groups, avoiding perpetuation of prejudices (E.5.c). Career professionals also may choose to refrain from a diagnosis or recommendation if they believe it would cause harm (E.5.d). Professionals must consider validity, reliability, and appropriateness of instruments before choosing assessments (E.6.a). When they refer a client to a third party for assessment, career professionals provide specific referral questions to ensure appropriate assessments are chosen (E.6.b).

Guideline E.7 directs career professionals in administering assessment tools. Assessments must be administered under the same conditions established in their standardization and the technology used must function well (E.7.a and E.7.b). Administration must be adequately supervised and administered under a favorable environment (E.7.c and E.7.d). Career professionals use caution when implementing instruments or assessment techniques normed on populations other than that of the client, particularly paying attention to dimensions of diversity that may affect assessment results (E.8). Career professionals also consider the client’s culture and how much he or she is able to understand the results before interpreting assessment results, realizing the potential impact of the results (E.9.a). They use caution to ensure the validity of the instruments they use (E.9.b). If career professionals use an assessment service (third party provider), they take care to make sure to confirm the validity of the instrument and interpretations (E.9.c).

Career professionals are ethically bound to keep assessment tools secure, not use obsolete tools or results, and to use established procedures for constructing an instrument (E.10 through E.12). Four additional ethical guidelines focus on forensic evaluations used in legal proceedings. First, the primary obligation of the career professional is to be objective, basing their testimony on scientific evidence and defining the limits of their testimony (E.13.a). Informed consent includes ensuring individuals that the purpose of the forensic relationship is for evaluation, not career services (E.13.b). Career professionals do not evaluate current or former clients, their romantic or sexual partners, or their family members (E.13.c), which constitutes a multiple relationship. Further, career professionals do not provide forensic evaluations for their own family members, romantic partners, or close friends (E.13.d).

1. **Providing Career Services Online, Technology, and Social Media**

Section F guides career practitioners in the use of online services, technology, and social media. The ethics guidelines are very similar to the guidelines provided earlier, particularly in Section A, but acknowledge the additional security and technical concerns that are inherent in using online services. Online services may also occur when clients and professionals are in different states or even countries, adding additional layers of legal concerns. For example, if career professionals engage in providing services online, they must be competent not just in the services they provide, but also in the technology and legal issues surrounding those services (F.1.a. and F.1.b), particularly if services cross state or national boundaries. They may seek help from others for legal and technical assistance (F.1.c). Informed consent is more complicated when not done face to face, and F.2.a details the information that must be added to informed consent for online services. Clients must be informed of the limits of confidentiality when services are conducted online, and career professionals are bound to take extra precautions for security (F.2.b and F.2.c). Career professionals must take the extra steps to verify the client’s identity (F.3). Guideline F.4 discusses issues related specifically to providing services online, including the benefits and limitations of using online services, and the need to maintain (and discuss with a client) professional boundaries, as often online services are provided and received in personal homes (F.4.a and F.4.b). The onus for ensuring the client’s ability to use technology rests with the career professional, as does ensuring that clients have reasonable access to technology (F.4.c and F.4.d).

Professionals understand the differences between face-to-face services and technology-provided services and how that might affect the relationship and career development process (F.4.e). In addition to the guidelines in Section E related to assessment, career professionals must ensure that the assessments used are appropriate for online delivery and validated for self-help use, that confidentiality is ensured, and that referrals are available within the client’s geographic area if the client does not understand the results (F.4.f).

This section of the Code includes guidelines related to maintaining electronic records and maintaining a professional website (F.5 and F.6), which include that the website is up to date and functional (F.6.a). Career professionals often use online services to help clients with job searching and assessment, and it is incumbent on them to provide access to those services for individuals with disabilities, make sure the website developer has input from a career professional, and that any job postings are valid openings (F.6.b and F.6.d).

Several guidelines in F.7 focus on the ethics unique to using social media, including ensuring that professionals who create a virtual presence in social media keep it up to date and accurate, keep their professional and personal social media sites separate, and make sure they are accurate in presenting their training and qualifications on the site (F.7.a through F.7.c). Confidentiality and privacy are particular concerns in Guidelines F.7.d and F.7.e, noting that clients’ identities must be protected and their privacy respected. Social media must be part of informed consent (including the limitations of social media use), the use of social media strategies must be developed with a consideration of fair and equitable treatment, and professionals must realize that information on social media sites are relatively permanent (F.7.f through F.7.h), thus necessitating extra care for privacy settings and information about clients. Career professionals posting information on social media sites must be concerned about copyright status of original sources (F.7.i). Finally, career professionals are encouraged to educate their clients about the role of social media in the career development process (F.7.j).

1. **Supervision, Training, and Teaching**

Section G encompasses guidelines fostering professional relationships that career professionals have with students and supervisees. As supervisors, career professionals put clients’ welfare as paramount, monitor their supervisor's cases, and meet with them regularly; they make sure that students appropriately inform clients that they are in training, and follow ethical guidelines regarding informed consent (G.1.a through G.1.c). They ensure they are competent to provide supervision (G.2), maintain appropriate professional relationships with students and supervisees (G.3 and G.5.f), and appropriately provide students with evaluation (G.5.d, G.5.e, and G.5.g). The guidelines outline supervisor responsibilities (G.4) as well as student responsibilities (G.5). The latter includes students’ obligation to know the code, monitor themselves for impairment, and appropriately disclose their trainee status to clients (G.5.a through G.5.c).

As educators, career professionals must be competent as teachers and practitioners (G.6.a and G.6.b) and clearly indicate when techniques are “unproven” (G.6.e). They are encouraged to integrate ethics into their teaching (G.6.c). They also ensure students are qualified for placements and sites are prepared for these students (G.6.f). Guideline G.6.f includes an explicit expectation that educators will ensure on-site supervisors are qualified to provide supervision. Educators provide appropriate information to students throughout their training and disclose in all public documents their expectations for self-disclosure. Students have a right to choose their educational program with clear understanding about the expected level of self-disclosure (G.7). Educators develop their programs with particular concern for faculty and student diversity and ensure multicultural competence is part of the curriculum (G.8).

1. **Research and Publication**

Guideline H addresses the ethical practice of conducting research as a career professional (H.1). Career professionals must safeguard the rights of research participants and must not have personal relationships with research participants nor engage in research with those with whom they have a personal relationship (H.2 and H.3). They must report all results accurately and work to maintain the confidentiality of research participants (H.4). When publishing their work, they follow all the guidelines related to appropriate authorship credit and publication practices (H.5).

1. **Resolving Ethical Issues**

The final set of guidelines addresses the processes and guidelines for resolving ethical issues. This includes potential conflicts between the Ethics Code and the law (I.1). When ethical violations occur, career professionals are encouraged to attempt informal resolutions prior to reporting the ethical violation (I.2). If formal complaints need to be made, they are done after professional consultation, and unwarranted complaints are prohibited. Career professionals are expected to cooperate with state and association ethics committees (I.3).

### Cultural contexts and Career Counseling.? <a href="#_hzozqg8zpurc" id="_hzozqg8zpurc"></a>

Mark, a White career counselor specializing in midlife career transitions, has two new clients. The first is an African American lesbian from a conservative Muslim family who is seeking to change careers in her 40s. Mark has been trained to consider culture and so knows that he needs to have an understanding of the cultural values of African Americans, of career issues facing lesbians, and of the Muslim faith that may suggest conflicts between the client’s sexual orientation and faith. He plans to ask the client which of her cultural contexts are most salient to her (race, sexual orientation, faith, age) and where she is feeling conflict. He wants to know her career history and how discrimination may have shaped her choices and perceptions of opportunity.

Mark’s second client is a White man in his 50s who is considering taking a new position in another company prior to retirement. Because they are the same race, Mark does not ask his client about cultural context. Because they are both men, Mark assumes that work plays a similar role in his client’s life as it does in his own. Thus, he misses key information about the client’s social class and upbringing and the importance of his role as a provider that would have helped him be more effective. The client was raised in considerable poverty in rural Nebraska, had to drop out of high school to support his family, and was able to work his way up the corporate ladder without the typical education his position requires. It is very important to him to be the primary provider for his family. His consideration of a new position is shaped strongly by the need for job security and fear of judgment about his lack of education.

These two cases highlight that all clients operate within a cultural context, which helps form their environments and their responses to the environment. Clients’ contexts must be taken into consideration in developing hypotheses about clients because contextual factors shape clients’ approach to work, the messages they receive about appropriate work, and the role that they want work to play in their lives. But, as we highlighted in the example of Mark, it is critical that career counselors first have a foundational understanding of the potential influences of context on their own perceptions and worldviews as well as on their clients’ perceptions and worldviews. The NCDA Career Counseling Competencies mandate that the competent career counselor “is aware of his/her own cultural beliefs and assumptions and incorporates that awareness into his/her decision-making about interactions with clients/students and other career professionals” (p. 1).

In this chapter, we discuss the need for an understanding of the implications of various contextual factors on work-related decisions and how that becomes integrated into career counseling. By context we mean clients’ psychological perspectives and world views that are shaped by their background, including such aspects as their culture, race/ethnicity, gender, social class, sexual orientation, religion, and/or disability status. Individuals’ contexts may shape their decisions in several ways. For some, cultural values or family expectations shape the type of work they will choose to do or feel is appropriate. For others, choices are limited by real and perceived barriers, such as limitations due to racism, sexism, or heterosexism. Career counselors must have an understanding of the potential role of context in clients’ lives. This is the foundation of culturally responsive career counseling.

**Culturally Responsive Career Counseling**

Culturally responsive career counseling is good for all clients. All clients come to counseling with unique biological, social, and developmental experiences that are products of the cultures to which they belong. It is also critical to note that belonging to a culture does not automatically mean that a client will display one characteristic or another. Rather, there is great heterogeneity within groups. Counselors need to be flexible enough to incorporate the cultural variables salient to the client. This requires that the counselor has developed multicultural competencies and is prepared for culturally appropriate counseling (Sue & Sue, 2015). While we discuss various contextual factors that may influence clients’ work-related decisions, it is beyond the scope of this chapter to address all possible contextual factors that clients bring to counseling. We refer readers to Sue and Sue (2015) for general multicultural counseling considerations and Brown and Lent (2013) and Blustein (2013) for in-depth discussion of contextual factors related to career counseling.

A central tenet of culturally appropriate career counseling is that effective career counselors do not treat all clients the same, assuming their cultural experiences are uniform, but will approach each client as belonging to one or more cultures. For example, a client may be an Asian American man married to a White woman, working in a company headed by an African American, and living in an ethnically diverse, middle-class neighborhood. He may feel that he belongs to several cultures; some may be more salient to him than others. His counselor needs to be aware of his multiple cultures and how they interact. The client’s goals will reflect his cultural contexts, indicating which are most salient to him.

Culturally appropriate counseling requires that the counselor have knowledge and skills to work with specific cultural groups. A counselor working with Hmong clients in the Midwest needs to know the history of the Hmong immigration to the United States, the development of their written language, and their cultural norms and values. A career counselor working with a transgender client needs to understand the issues relevant to the transition from one sex to another and the workplace concerns of transgender individuals. A counselor working with a woman who is seeking to be an electrical engineer will need to understand the issues for women choosing nontraditional occupations. But while counselors need to know certain group-specific issues, counselors also need to be aware of several overarching variables that may affect many clients.

**Fouad and Kantamneni’s Three Dimensional Model**

To help career counselors capture the complexity and intersections of various aspects of identity and how they influence career and work decisions, we have adopted the three dimensional model proposed by Fouad and Kantamneni (2008) and shown in figure below.

The first dimension includes individual characteristics that influence work choices, such as interests, values, and abilities. These characteristics encompass the traditional areas that career counselors have emphasized: what a client is able to do, what a client is interested in, and what choices are consistent with the client’s values. We focus on assessing these constructs and, indeed the assessment of interests, abilities, and values forms the heart of much of career counseling.

But the relationship between individuals’ interests, abilities, and values and the possible choices they consider are shaped by the second and third dimensions of the model. The group level variables in the second dimension encompass gender, race/ethnicity, social class, family variables, religion, sexual orientation, and relationships. Thus, individuals’ work choices are influenced not only by their own interests, abilities, and values but also by the messages they receive about appropriate and possible work based on those group-level dimensions. Some individuals, for example, would not consider an occupation in which the workers are mostly the opposite sex. Others might choose work that they would consider friendly to gays and lesbians, while still others might choose work in which they feel a spiritual calling.

The third dimension is the broader society in which individuals live. Some individuals may feel they belong to the majority culture in the United States and their cultural values, such as achievement, recognition or helping others, influence their work choices and decisions. For others, the predominant values in their culture of origin differ from the majority culture, and these differences influence work decisions as well (including acculturation, discrimination, and cultural barriers). This third dimension also includes the societal effects such as educational systems, the labor market, and the economy.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/0 (3)>)

**Fig. Fouad and Kantamneni’s Three-Dimensional Model - Source: Fouad and Kantamneni (2008)**

Kantamneni and Fouad (2019) have critiqued this model, noting that the cube model does not allow enough examination among factors within a dimension, such as the intersection between gender and social class, or social class and race, or how barriers and the labor market intersect. They also argued that more factors need to be considered, such as including age as a group-level factor, and adding public policies to the societal dimension. Career counselors should keep these critiques in mind, particularly considering intersections among variables. Researchers have examined the role of context in work choices and decisions over the past three decades, primarily examining group-level variables such as gender and race and the societal variables of acculturation and discrimination. More recently, research has focused on social class, sexual orientation, and religion/spirituality. We discuss selected group-level and societal level variables separately, but in real life, many aspects of context influence work decisions. For example, a Native American woman in her 30s may be influenced by her gender, her age, and her Native American values and how those differ from the majority culture values. She may not know which are important influences on her choices, but an effective counselor will help her explore those influences.

The model portrayed in the figure above is a cube, highlighting the interaction among the various dimensions. More critically, although we assume interactions among dimensions, some may be more salient at one time than another. We finish our examination of context with a discussion of the practical implications of salience of intersecting aspects of identity.

**Group-Level Variables**

We begin our discussion of group-level variables by noting the tension between wanting to treat all group members the same and overemphasizing those differences. Hare-Mustin and Marecek (1988) provided a useful distinction on these two perspectives in studying the social construction of gender: One perspective emphasizes the differences between men and women, and the other minimizes those differences. They characterized the former perspective as prone to alpha bias, or the tendency to exaggerate differences, whereas the latter perspective is prone to beta bias, or the tendency to ignore differences. We can extend these perspectives to many of the group-level variables discussed in this section.

Alpha bias is the predominant view in U.S. society and underpins most psychological theories about gender. These theories propose fundamental gender differences as constellations of opposing traits or characteristics (such as feminine vs. masculine, instrumental vs. expressive). Beta bias, on the other hand, has received less attention but also exists in many theories of psychological development, particularly in the assumption that psychological development is the same across all races and for all types of sexual orientations. Beta bias is evident in theories and practices that attempt to treat men and women, and individuals of all races and sexual orientations, equally, yet may inadvertently perpetuate inequality.

One consequence of alpha bias is that observed sex or race differences (or differences between other groups) may be overinterpreted as essential qualities, when they may be due to differences in the social hierarchy. For example, demonstrated sex differences in vocational interests, such as women’s interest in social activities, may not be due to women’s inherent relational nature but because social-type careers include lower prestige occupations that are more accessible to women.

Consequences of beta bias are more subtle in nature and, on the surface, may seem trivial. After all, what’s wrong with arguing for little difference between men and women or different racial groups and therefore treating them similarly? However, ignoring special needs of women or men, or the influences of racism on psychological development of racial/ethnic minorities, may also underestimate differential allocation of resources and power and ultimately disadvantage women, men, or minority group members. Hare-Mustin and Marecek (1988) point out that “in a society in which one group holds most of the power, seemingly neutral actions usually benefit members of that group” (p. 460). In the realm of career and educational attainment, Betz (1989, 2005) discusses the “null environment” in which individuals are neither encouraged nor discouraged but simply ignored. The null environment, according to the originator of the concept (Freeman, 1979), has a greater effect on women because of the cumulative effect of negative messages about their pursuit of career goals. Heppner (2013) suggests that counselors be alert for women’s implicit foreclosure of occupations because of gender biases and develop mechanisms to gently challenge those biases. By the same token, it can be argued that similar concerns need to be explored with men who foreclose on traditionally female occupations.

**Gender**

It is axiomatic to say that gender is important throughout an individual’s life. Baby clothes and blankets are color-coded (pink for girls, blue for boys), toys are gender specific (trucks for boys, dolls for girls), and from an early age, boys and girls demonstrate (or are rewarded for demonstrating) different interests. It seems reasonable that these different expectations of behavior on boys and girls would result in different career choices. Until the 1970s, gender socialization practices traditionally expected girls to be helpers and boys to be prepared to be providers for their families.

These different expectations led to separate career trajectories and decisions, with women either choosing not to work or choosing to stop in and out of the work environment as they took primary responsibility for their families. The effect on men was to considerably restrict their options and their ability to be involved with their families. Although the past five decades have witnessed dramatic changes in workforce participation by women and greater options for men, the traditional socialization patterns and messages have continued to exert subtle influences on the work decisions of both men and women.

Many authors have argued that traditional theories of career development are really theories about and for White, middle-class males, so it is natural to focus our attention to how career theory and practice may better serve women. But clearly, men also are influenced by gender socialization and the gendered context in which they make career choices. Societal expectations of the male gender role and what types of occupations are appropriate for men may restrict the range of options of occupations. However, the enormous societal changes that have occurred for women brought about changes for men as well—in their conceptions of the role of work in their lives, in the expectations that are placed upon them by society, and in the structure of the family and interpersonal relationships. It is still important to note that gender socialization occurs for both males and females in this society, beginning from birth onward, through childhood, adolescence, and into adulthood.

**Race/Ethnicity**

Just as gender has a strong role in career and work-related choices, so does an individual’s race and ethnicity. We have noted previously that there is large occupational segregation by race/ethnicity, as well as gender, with an overrepresentation of racial/ethnic group individuals in the lower socioeconomic status (SES) levels and overrepresentation of White men in higher SES levels. The strong relationships between SES and educational attainment and occupational level have led to a continuous cycle of poor and poorly educated minority men and women (Arbona, 1996; Kenney & Walsh-Blair, 2012; Worthington, Flores, & Navarro, 2005). Discrimination has also played a role in keeping individuals trapped in this cycle. Overt sexism and racism are outlawed in the United States, but unfortunately, covert sexism and racism are still facts of life for women and racial/ethnic minorities and often limit the options that individuals may consider and restrict their access to a wide variety of opportunities (ByarsWinston, Fouad, & Wen, 2015; Byars-Winston, Kantamneni, & Mobley, 2012). In addition, the relationship between discrimination and poverty has a particularly disproportionate effect on racial/ethnic groups and single women, including negative effects of discrimination on mental health (Roberts, Swanson, & Murphy, 2004).

**Relational and Familial Influences**

Traditional notions of career development suggest that work choices are made individually. However, researchers and career counselors are increasingly acknowledging the role that relationships and family play in career decisions (Blustein, 2011; Lustig & Xu, 2018; Richardson, 2012). Researchers have shown that positive family relationships can help individuals feel free to explore various careers while negative relationships can restrict behaviors leading to career exploration (Blustein, Schultheiss, & Flum, 2004; Richie et al., 1997). The role of family in influencing career decisions differs by culture and gender (Fouad et al., 2010; Whiston & Cinamon, 2015), and it is important for career counselors to ask about messages that clients may have received from their family about work and careers.

**Social Class**

A major criticism of the field is that it has neglected the concerns of poor or working class individuals when compared to middle class or wealthy individuals (Blustein, 2006). Yet social class clearly is an influential factor in career development. Social class is fundamental in shaping access to resources and influencing career aspirations, development, and eventual career attainment (Blustein et al., 2002; Brown, Fukunaga, Umemoto, & Wicker, 1996; Diemer & Ali, 2009; Fouad & Brown, 2000). For example, lower income students are less likely to be raised in homes with enriched learning environments, less likely to receive career guidance and information from their parents, and less likely to have strong career expectations, which leads to lower career attainment (Flores, Navarro, & Ali, 2017; Fouad & Byars-Winston, 2005).

**Difference from Mainstream Culture**

The United States includes individuals from many backgrounds who bring values and perspectives from their own culture of origin, who may then encounter conflicting experiences and messages related to the world of work in the larger mainstream United States. Recent qualitative studies have highlighted this experience, as racial/ethnic minority individuals described having to navigate between two cultures (Gomez et al., 2001, Juntunen et al., 2001). Participants, all who had successful careers, reported essentially developing a bicultural identity that allowed them to incorporate values from both cultures in making work related decisions.

Two factors influence the way that individuals navigate between two cultures. The first is acculturation, which describes the way individuals change, accommodate, or adopt the cultural patterns of the “host” society (Kohatsu, 2005). Some individuals completely acculturate to the United States; some are able to be bicultural, retaining the cultural patterns of their culture of origin and adopt certain patterns of the United States; and still others are unable to accommodate or acculturate to the United States. As may be clear, the role of acculturation can be very influential in perceiving and obtaining work in the United States.

However, despite actual and perceived barriers, many individuals successfully achieve. Returning to the qualitative studies described earlier (e.g., Gomez et al., 2001; Juntunen et al., 2001; Richie et al., 1997) participants noted sources of resilience in the face of barriers, including support from their families, a strong sense of identity, and feelings of passion about their work. Bicultural individuals also have been found to be satisfied and have a strong sense of well-being, highlighting the strengths and resilience that comes with operating in two cultures (Quintana, Chew, & Schell, 2012). Career counselors are encouraged to ask clients about sources of cultural strengths.

**Influences from Mainstream Culture**

Individuals in the United States work within a society that transmits central assumptions about work in general. For example, U.S. assumptions include “Everyone should work; Mothers should not work; All work is good; Some work is better than others; Working with one’s hands is good; Working with one’s mind is better than working with one’s hands; Education ought to result in better work; Education ought to result in better pay.” These societal assumptions shape expectations about work. The larger societal beliefs influence the perceptions of whether to work, how much to work, and which work to do.

As we noted earlier, the U.S. mainstream culture emphasizes doing rather than being; has a high value on achievement; is somewhat low on tolerance for uncertainty and somewhat low on power distance, or the distance between those in authority and subordinates (Gelfand et al., 2007). These values shape policies around individual achievement, educational opportunities for all, and limited unemployment and family leave benefits. Educational policies and funding for schooling helps shape eventual career and work opportunities. For example, concerns about the science and math abilities of U.S. students relative to many other countries have led to additional funding for science, technology, engineering, and math education. The recession of 2008 and increasing globalization have also influenced how individuals make work-related choices and decisions.

**Culturally Appropriate Career Counseling Model**

We argued the importance of integrating clients’ context into career counseling earlier in this chapter. In this section, we discuss a model that helps career counselors explicitly incorporate culture in counseling. The culturally appropriate career counseling model (CACCM) specifically assesses the impact of cultural variables in each step of career counseling (Figure 4.2). The CACCM is an extension of models originally proposed by Ward and Bingham (1993; Bingham & Ward, 1994).

### Career construction Theory and Life Designing Paradigm. <a href="#_9y3kikl2lnk6" id="_9y3kikl2lnk6"></a>

In the past several decades, substantial changes have occurred within the world of work, with a concomitant change to the field of vocational psychology, and new theoretical approaches are emerging in an effort to better explain career and work behavior (Fouad, 2007; Juntunen & Even, 2012; Pope, 2015). Theories of career development (or vocational choice) have shifted from a sole focus on the individual, to an explicit recognition of contextual factors, to a perspective that might be best described as a “person-in-complex-social-and-economic-systems” focus (Blustein et al., in press; Duffy, Blustein, Diemer, & Autin, 2016; Swanson, 2013). These newer approaches are characterized by several different primary emphases, including (a) equal valuing of work and relationship, or market and care work, (b) viewing work within a broader context of relational aspects, (c) expanding consideration of the experience of work beyond that of career, and (d) building on postmodern perspectives of work.

These newer and emerging theories have been described as paradigm-shifting (Richardson, 2012), in that they represent a radical departure from previous views and an opening up of new perspectives to understanding behavior and events that would previously have not been considered valid. These newer perspectives represent a marked departure from foundational theories, yet there also are clear continuities with the earlier theories. For example, Frank Parsons (1909/1989), who is credited with launching the field of vocational guidance, published his landmark work in response to social change occurring at the beginning of the 20th century, and the newly emerging and contemporary perspectives may also be characterized by their responsiveness to social change (Juntunen & Even, 2012).

**Applying Career Construction/Life Designing**

Career construction theory focuses on the subjective elements of Leslie’s career history and present situation, through the process of self-construction, as well as her level of career adaptability.

**Conceptualizing Leslie’s Career History**

As a child and adolescent, Leslie began to build a story about herself as a teacher and helper. She internalized the message from her parents about the importance of achievement but did not develop a strong sense of how that achievement would be expressed in the world through occupational roles. In terms of the four dimensions of career adaptability, as an adolescent and young adult, Leslie seemed to have an appropriate level of concern about her career, including understanding the importance of making plans for the future.

Regarding the second dimension of control, Leslie at times seemed to cede control to others, such as her family and boyfriend, which may have led to her indecision about career choices. Messages from her family may have increased her indecision, since they encouraged the lessened centrality of the occupational role in her life. Leslie’s decisions about career, then, were frequently made with clear reference to her current relationships and informed by expectations conveyed by her parents about the relative roles of work and family; her initial decision to become a high school teacher was an effort to combine work and family.

Despite not totally mastering control, she did demonstrate curiosity about her career alternatives, as she developed interests and skills in mathematics. Finally, she demonstrated wavering levels of confidence, the fourth dimension, resulting in times when she has seemed stuck about how to move forward and unsure of her abilities.

**Conceptualizing Leslie’s Present Situation**

In terms of career construction theory, Leslie is now reconstructing her occupational story by reevaluating her previous choices and whether to continue or change direction. Revisiting the four dimensions of career adaptability, Leslie’s decision to pursue career counseling demonstrates her concern about planning for the future and taking control over her future. Combining work and family is at the forefront given her expressed desire to have a child. Her relationship with Joe is also central to her current career issues, in terms of his reactions to her career concerns. Leslie also seems to have a fair amount of curiosity and confidence about her options.

### Directions and Implications for Career Counseling <a href="#_tkwb34xa6gpo" id="_tkwb34xa6gpo"></a>

**Goals of Counseling**

The paradigm of life designing is not meant to replace earlier paradigms, in terms of the goals and purpose of career counseling, and counselors should use different paradigmatic approaches as directed by a client’s needs (Savickas, 2015). In life designing, counselors “must help clients find a way to deal with what they feel they must” (Savickas, 2011, p. 49). The counselor begins with the question “How can I be useful to you as you construct your career?” (p. 49), and uses the answer to this question to structure the initial intervention.

**Interventions**

The life-designing paradigm for career counseling is described by Savickas (2015) as consisting of three phases: (a) constructing career through small stories, (b) reconstructing these “micro narratives into a macro narrative or life portrait” (p. 138), and (c) co constructing a client’s intentions that lead to the next action. He likens these three phases to a three-act drama, in which the first act introduces the character, the second act presents the core conflict and ends with an understanding that leads to a moment of truth, and the third act reveals changes prompted by the new understanding (Savickas, 2018).

**Construction**

Clients may pursue career counseling when their current career narrative is disrupted or no longer provides meaning. The initial question (“How can I be useful as you construct your career?”) leads to the five-question Career Construction Interview, in which the counselor encourages the client to tell small stories (micro narratives) about how he or she has “made a self, shaped an identity, and constructed a career” (Savickas, 2015, p. 138). These stories are important to identifying themes in a client’s career story. Savickas (2018) recommends preparing the client for this interview by explaining that the questions help to tell the client’s career story.

Cybersecurity is undoubtedly an essential aspect of the proper functioning of every business enterprise. It fundamentally acts as the nerve center to which information is recorded, stored and transferred to various personnel within the organization. With the rising cases of data breaches occurring almost every day, the war of talent in InfoSec is stronger than ever.

Recent graduates can view this highly coveted opportunity as a glass-half-full scenario; you gain meaningful employment while companies harness the much-needed expertise from cybersecurity experts. Cybersecurity experts are usually handsomely compensated for their services and what you need to compete for these positions are the right skills.

Every employer strives to hire cybersecurity professionals with a handful of soft and hard skills, including:

**Strong Research and Writing Skills**

Possessing strong research and writing instincts is an invaluable asset that each information security analyst must have. Such a skill comes in handy when experts execute policy creation and enforcement. This essentially means that cybersecurity staff must conduct intensive research and work with end users to understand how technology is harnessed daily.

**Collaboration**

One of the most important skills that a cyber security expert can possess is the ability to effectively communicate with others. This involves being able to listen to and understand the concerns of others, as well as being able to explain complex technical concepts in a way that is easy to understand. Additionally, it is important to be able to build relationships with others in the organization, as this can help to build trust and collaboration.

**Adaptability**

Working in cybersecurity predominantly requires having a passion for learning. You’ll need to be a lifelong student as much as a teacher. Typically, the IT threat landscape is constantly changing with new viruses, worms, and susceptible firewalls. Keeping up with the latest vulnerabilities and persistent threats can give you an edge to thrive.

**Networking**

Networking in terms of “getting to know you” is a critical tool that goes way beyond the technical side. It entails harnessing your social and communication skills to expand your professional contacts and connect, which is paramount in your career development.

You can also use this opportunity to tap into the experience of the professionals you connect with to cultivate your critical thinking skills and improve the organization’s performance. You also need skills necessary to express complex concepts verbally and in writing, interpersonal skills to listen actively to others, as well as good presentation skills.

#### **Hard Skills** <a href="#_wp6poc7ficp0" id="_wp6poc7ficp0"></a>

### Identify a Career that Fits your Values. <a href="#_zijtnjsz8vw1" id="_zijtnjsz8vw1"></a>

**(**[**How to Assess Your Career Values**](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-are-career-values-with-examples-2059752) **)**

When considering a new job or career, your career values count as one of the most important factors that will guide your choices. You'll also sometimes hear them referred to as "work values."

Knowing what you value in a job and workplace can help you evaluate career options to consider and assist you with choosing a job that's the best fit for your values.

**What Are Career Values?**

Your career values represent the beliefs you have about what is important in your work, and what makes it meaningful to you.

Simply put, your career values are what steer and drive you in your professional career. These values will help when you decide on a potential company or position for employment.

**What Do You Want From a Job?**

People look for different things in their jobs. Some crave prestige, while others seek a creative outlet. Still others want flexible hours and independence.

The list of desires can include earning a high income and meeting and interacting with people. Of course, the chance for advancement in the career field is also a primary driver of why people will choose any particular position.

Once you figure out what you value, you'll have the answer to what motivates you to do your best job, and you can use this knowledge to guide your employment choices.

**Career Satisfaction**

Some career theorists believe that how well a job or career satisfies our values should be the most important consideration when evaluating options.

These theorists posit that work which lines up with our values will be more meaningful, and we will be more likely to invest our energies to master the roles and achieve success. Most career experts recommend considering personality traits, interests and abilities in conjunction with values when making career choices.

**Identifying Your Values**

One way to identify your career values is to look at a list of examples and rate how much each of the items matters to you. Rate the list on a scale of one to ten. Then examine some of the highest-rated values and choose six to 10 that should have the greatest weight when considering career and alternatives.

You can also separate these descriptive terms into categories, such as who, what, where, and workload. Instead of a numerical ranking system, you may choose to rank the terms using:

* Must have
* Nice to have
* OK not to have
* Must not have

### Career Counseling in Postmodern Times: Emergence and Narrative and Conception <a href="#_iovob9nk05t2" id="_iovob9nk05t2"></a>

_“I define postmodern as incredulity toward meta-narratives.”_

—J. F. Lyotard, The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge

For several decades, social, economic, and political forces have aligned to make work more unstable in Western societies, including in the United States. Shaped by a global economy and propelled by information technology, the new social arrangement has been characterized by uncertain and precarious employment opportunities (Kalleberg, 2009). This restructuring has diminished the standardized job, changed the relationship between worker and employer, and posed a threat to personal meaningfulness. As society moves from high modernity to postmodern times, existing career theories do not adequately account for today's unpredictable and rapidly changing occupational structure (Savickas, 2011a). Established paths and narratives that once guided many people's career progression have eroded. New demands require individuals to repeatedly revise their identities, accept more responsibility for managing their own lives, and invest in their families and communities for stability. Client questions such as “How do I fit in?” or “How do I advance my career?” have transformed into concerns such as “Who am I?” or “Where can I find purpose?” Postmodern career counseling emphasizes the importance of meaningful work and of holding oneself together while developing a career (Savickas, 2011b). Counselors now ask themselves an implicit question: How do we counsel clients when security and stability in the workplace are no longer guaranteed?

In this chapter, I provide an overview of how postmodern career counseling answers this question. Drawing on sociological theory and thought, I first discuss how societal and organizational narratives within each work era provided external guides for people to help them feel secure in an increasingly precarious work environment. I examine some factors responsible for how work in a postmodern era has diminished the standardized job, changed the psychological contract between worker and employer, and affected people's identities. Then I propose a new metanarrative for postmodern society, highlight implications for culturally diverse groups, and conclude with a brief discussion on narrative career counseling in culture and context.

_“There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.”_

—Maya Angelou

Applying a postmodernist epistemology to career counseling is not a new phenomenon. Whenever a helper has listened to the lived experience of a person as a component of career decision making, it is likely that a postmodern approach to career assessment was being used. In this chapter, we provide an overview of postmodern or qualitative career assessment. We begin by defining some key terms and follow that with a discussion of the advantages of qualitative career assessments along with the potential challenges. In the final section we focus on a variety of qualitative career assessments and how they are used by career counselors.

**Definitions of Terms**

Shared definitions are important to understanding postmodern career assessment, and we begin by defining these key terms: career development, positivist and postpositivist, postmodernism, epistemological tradition, qualitative (nontraditional) career assessment, and traditional career assessment. Sears (1982) defined career development as “the total constellation of economic, sociological, psychological, educational, physical, and chance factors that combine to shape one's career” (p. 139). The comprehensive nature of career development and the important consideration of sociopolitical context within which this shaping occurs are central to this definition. The task of career assessment—to capture so many factors operating in such idiosyncratic ways—is fraught with shortcomings.

The terms positivist and postpositivist refer to a system of beliefs based in a logical, objective reality that is best learned through direct observation (and the rigors of the scientific method). The origins of the career counseling profession are largely based in this positivist tradition (Patton & McMahon, 1999). Postmodernism changes that focus and assumes that knowledge is not static and that there are no universal or absolute truths to be objectively identified by scientific inquiry. Moreover, most of what we refer to as “truth” or “fact” is socially constructed through language and dialogue. The primacy of the context within which knowledge is created is essential to postmodern thought. The term epistemology refers to “ways of knowing,” and, more specifically, the epistemological tradition refers to organized schools of thought or common understandings of how we come to learn and know.

Qualitative career assessment refers to instruments and activities that use qualitative research methods (e.g., open-ended questions, thick/rich description of context, and prolonged engagement) to gather information for the purpose of assisting individuals or groups in the process of career development. Examples of qualitative career assessments include card sorts, Life Role Analysis, Life Design Genogram, and My Career Chapter. In qualitative career assessments, the way in which the assessment is administered can be tailored to context, constituents, or both, and the subsequent results will be responsive to greater shaping by both counselor and client. McMahon, Patton, and Watson (2003) noted that in the interpretation of qualitative assessments there is an emphasis on the meaning of personal traits and events within the context of a person's life circumstances. Personal meaning on the part of the career counseling client/student is more important than the counselor's interpretation in qualitative career assessments.

Traditional career assessments use quantitative measures with standardized formats (e.g., true/false questions, multiple-choice answer options, and short answer questions) with a protocol for administration based on the instrument itself rather than a format made to fit the client's needs. These quantitative career assessments are often standardized with some number of psychometric properties emerging from the test's construction as well as from any subsequent empirical research (Wood & Hays, 2013).

These are simplistic definitions of complicated concepts, and we use qualitative career assessment and nontraditional career assessment somewhat synonymously here. Moreover, although some authors view formal or informal categories of career assessment as being synonymous with quantitative or qualitative approaches, we do not. We distinguish qualitative career assessment from the broader category of informal career assessment based on the following factors: They are holistic, existentialist, constructivist, change generating (McMahon et al., 2003), subjective, personal/social, meaningful, oriented to a client's real life, humanistic, and interpersonal.

Although little had been written about qualitative assessments until the past decade, qualitative assessments are not new to professional practice. Qualitative career assessments may have been more pervasive in practice than is represented in the scholarly literature and may indeed have a more extensive history than many of the more traditional quantitative career assessments.

### Advantages of Qualitative Career Assessments <a href="#_lzii4vsqegba" id="_lzii4vsqegba"></a>

Qualitative career assessments are interventions intended to assist an individual in increasing self-awareness and meaning while attending to the contextual dimensions of her or his life (Gysbers, 2006; McMahon & Patton, 2006; Whiston & Rahardja, 2005). This approach to career assessment is most consistent with the epistemological tradition of constructivism.

Drawing on a constructivist learning perspective, these assessments can be tailored to meet a client's individual needs and life circumstances. Schultheiss (2005) noted that qualitative career assessments are more holistic in nature and tend to foster greater client involvement in the career assessment process.

They also can be more useful in helping clients generate new meanings about all aspects of life in relation to career planning. Qualitative career assessments are inclusive of a client's life context, are well-suited for working with diverse populations, and support a social justice approach to working with marginalized groups.

McMahon and Patton (2006) pointed to the earlier work of Goldman (1990, 1992) in describing additional advantages of qualitative assessment:

* Encourages the client to be engaged and actively involved in collecting information and discerning meaning
* Is more holistic and systemic
* Contextualizes learning about oneself within a developmental framework
* Encourages a collaborative relationship between counselor and client
* Is suitable for groups focused on learning and growth
* Is flexible and adaptable when used with clients from diverse backgrounds

Savickas (1992) maintained that qualitative career assessment puts an emphasis on the counseling relationship as opposed to viewing career assessment as the delivery of a service. Busacca (2007) noted that engagement and collaboration ultimately call for different roles to be enacted by counselors and clients using qualitative career assessments within the career construction approach. These different counselor and client roles emphasize the counseling process: Meaning is articulated as the process unfolds rather than being presented after the final results of the assessment are evident. As with other qualitative approaches to counseling, the role of the client moves from passive to active, and the position of the counselor moves from that of expert to one of an interested, curious, and tentative inquirer.

The flexibility and adaptability of qualitative career assessments also allow for the consideration of socio political and economic context. Maree (2013) noted the role of the changing global economy in increased utilization of constructivist approaches to career assessment when serving the unique needs of 21st-century career counseling clients. Career information and occupational outlook data increasingly take globalization into consideration, but quantitative career assessments such as interest inventories fail to incorporate these considerations in the assessment results.

Access to career resources and services is a social justice issue (Sampson, Dozier, & Colvin, 2011; Sampson, McClain, Musch, & Reardon, 2011), as is access to career assessments (Sampson, 2009). Qualitative career assessments are more oriented toward social justice in several ways. First, as many qualitative career assessments are available for free, the cost-prohibitive nature of commercially offered quantitative career assessments is eliminated for clients. Second, as alternative models of staffing and delivery of career services are explored (Sampson, 2009), some qualitative career assessments offer self-guided activities that can be done before or after career counseling sessions. Further, the infusion of counseling for social justice and advocacy competencies can be a part of career counseling processes (Butler, 2012; Pope & Pangelinan, 2010), as can be the promotion of prosocial values (Dik, Duffy, & Steger, 2012) and the infusion of advocacy competencies in career development programs (Gysbers, Lapan, & Cato, 2013).

### Do What Contributes to the world. <a href="#_jisku6z0d6wb" id="_jisku6z0d6wb"></a>

**(** [80,000 Hours: Find a fulfilling career that does good.: Todd, Benjamin J: 9781537324005](https://www.amazon.com/80-000-Hours-fulfilling-career/dp/1537324004/ref=sr\_1\_7?crid=16QG3MXF065YJ\&keywords=career\&qid=1649311246\&s=books\&sprefix=care%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C1014\&sr=1-7\&asin=1537324004\&revisionId=\&format=4\&depth=1)**)**

Rather than “follow your passion”, our slogan for a fulfilling career is: get good at something that helps others. Or simply: do what contributes. We highlight “getting good”, because if you find something you’re good at that others value, you’ll have plenty of career opportunities, which gives you the best chance of finding a job with the other ingredients – engaging work, good colleagues, lack of major negatives, and fit with the rest of life. You can have all the other five ingredients, however, and still find your work meaningless. So you need to find a way to help others too. If you make a valuable contribution to the world first, you’ll develop passion for what you do – you’ll become more content, ambitious and motivated.

To date, over 1,000 people have made major changes to their career path by following our career advice. Many switched into a field that didn’t initially interest them, but that they believed was important for the world. After developing their skills, finding good people to work with, and the right role, they’ve become deeply satisfied. Here are two more reasons to focus on getting good at something that helps others.

**You’ll be more Successful**

If you make it your mission to help others, then people will want to help you succeed. This sounds obvious, and there’s now empirical evidence to back it up. In the excellent book Give and Take, Professor Adam Grant argues that people with a “giving mindset” end up among the most successful. This is both because they get more help, and because they’re more motivated by a sense of purpose. One caveat is that givers also end up unsuccessful if they focus too much on others, and burn out. So you also need the other ingredients of job satisfaction we mentioned earlier.

**It’s the right thing to do**

The idea that helping others is the key to being fulfilled is hardly a new one. It’s a theme from most major moral and spiritual traditions:

_A man’s true wealth is the good he does in this world._ – **Muhammad**

_Love your neighbor as you love yourself._ – **Jesus Christ**

_Set your heart on doing good. Do it over and over again and you will be filled with joy. –_ **Buddha**

Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness. – **Martin Luther King, Jr.**

What’s more, as we’ll explain in the next section, as a college graduate in a developed country today, you have an enormous opportunity to help others through your career. Ultimately, this is the real reason to focus on helping others – the fact that it’ll make you more personally fulfilled is just a bonus.
