### Postmodern Career Assessments: Advantages & Considerations:

“There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.” —Maya Angelou

Applying a postmodernist epistemology to career counseling is not a new phenomenon. Whenever a helper has listened to the lived experience of a person as a component of career decision making, it is likely that a postmodern approach to career assessment was being used. In this chapter, we provide an overview of postmodern or qualitative career assessment. We begin by defining some key terms and follow that with a discussion of the advantages of qualitative career assessments along with the potential challenges. In the final section we focus on a variety of qualitative career assessments and how they are used by career counselors.

### Definitions of Terms

Shared definitions are important to understanding postmodern career assessment, and we begin by defining these key terms: career development, positivist and postpositivist, postmodernism, epistemological tradition, qualitative (nontraditional) career assessment, and traditional career assessment. Sears (1982) defined career development as “the total constellation of economic, sociological, psychological, educational, physical, and chance factors that combine to shape one's career” (p. 139). The comprehensive nature of career development and the important consideration of sociopolitical context within which this shaping occurs are central to this definition. The task of career assessment—to capture so many factors operating in such idiosyncratic ways—is fraught with shortcomings. The terms positivist and postpositivist refer to a system of beliefs based in a logical, objective reality that is best learned through direct observation (and the rigors of the scientific method). The origins of the career counseling profession are largely based in this positivist tradition (Patton & McMahon, 1999). Postmodernism changes that focus and assumes that knowledge is not static and that there are no universal or absolute truths to be objectively identified by scientific inquiry. Moreover, most of what we refer to as “truth” or “fact” is socially constructed through language and dialogue. The primacy of the context within which knowledge is created is essential to postmodern thought. The term epistemology refers to “ways of knowing,” and, more specifically, the epistemological tradition refers to organized schools of thought or common understandings of how we come to learn and know. Qualitative career assessment refers to instruments and activities that use qualitative research methods (e.g., open-ended questions, thick/rich description of context, and prolonged engagement) to gather information for the purpose of assisting individuals or groups in the process of career development. Examples of qualitative career assessments include card sorts, Life Role Analysis, Life Design Genogram, and My Career Chapter. In qualitative career assessments, the way in which the assessment is administered can be tailored to context, constituents, or both, and the subsequent results will be responsive to greater shaping by both counselor and client. McMahon, Patton, and Watson (2003) noted that in the interpretation of qualitative assessments there is an emphasis on the meaning of personal traits and events within the context of a person's life circumstances. Personal meaning on the part of the career counseling client/student is more important than the counselor's interpretation in qualitative career assessments. Traditional career assessments use quantitative measures with standardized formats (e.g., true/false questions, multiple-choice answer options, and short answer questions) with a protocol for administration based on the instrument itself rather than a format made to fit the client's needs. These quantitative career assessments are often standardized with some number of psychometric properties emerging from the test's construction as well as from any subsequent empirical research (Wood & Hays, 2013). These are simplistic definitions of complicated concepts, and we use qualitative career assessment and nontraditional career assessment somewhat synonymously here. Moreover, although some authors view formal or informal categories of career assessment as being synonymous with quantitative or qualitative approaches, we do not. We distinguish qualitative career assessment from the broader category of informal career assessment based on the following factors: They are holistic, existentialist, constructivist, change generating (McMahon et al., 2003), subjective, personal/social, meaningful, oriented to a client's real life, humanistic, and interpersonal. Although little had been written about qualitative assessments until the past decade, qualitative assessments are not new to professional practice. Qualitative career assessments may have been more pervasive in practice than is represented in the scholarly literature and may indeed have a more extensive history than many of the more traditional quantitative career assessments.

### 10. Advantages of Qualitative Career Assessments

Qualitative career assessments are interventions intended to assist an individual in increasing self-awareness and meaning while attending to the contextual dimensions of her or his life (Gysbers, 2006; McMahon & Patton, 2006; Whiston & Rahardja, 2005). This approach to career assessment is most consistent with the epistemological tradition of constructivism. Drawing on a constructivist learning perspective, these assessments can be tailored to meet a client's individual needs and life circumstances. Schultheiss (2005) noted that qualitative career assessments are more holistic in nature and tend to foster greater client involvement in the career assessment process. They also can be more useful in helping clients generate new meanings about all aspects of life in relation to career planning. Qualitative career assessments are inclusive of a client's life context, are well-suited for working with diverse populations, and support a social justice approach to working with marginalized groups.

McMahon and Patton (2006) pointed to the earlier work of Goldman (1990, 1992) in describing additional advantages of qualitative assessment:

● Encourages the client to be engaged and actively involved in collecting information and discerning meaning&#x20;

● Is more holistic and systemic

&#x20;● Contextualizes learning about oneself within a developmental framework&#x20;

● Encourages a collaborative relationship between counselor and client&#x20;

● Is suitable for groups focused on learning and growth&#x20;

● Is flexible and adaptable when used with clients from diverse backgrounds

Savickas (1992) maintained that qualitative career assessment puts an emphasis on the counseling relationship as opposed to viewing career assessment as the delivery of a service. Busacca (2007) noted that engagement and collaboration ultimately call for different roles to be enacted by counselors and clients using qualitative career assessments within the career construction approach. These different counselor and client roles emphasize the counseling process: Meaning is articulated as the process unfolds rather than being presented after the final results of the assessment are evident. As with other qualitative approaches to counseling, the role of the client moves from passive to active, and the position of the counselor moves from that of expert to one of an interested, curious, and tentative inquirer. The flexibility and adaptability of qualitative career assessments also allow for the consideration of socio political and economic context. Maree (2013) noted the role of the changing global economy in increased utilization of constructivist approaches to career assessment when serving the unique needs of 21st-century career counseling clients. Career information and occupational outlook data increasingly take globalization into consideration, but quantitative career assessments such as interest inventories fail to incorporate these considerations in the assessment results. Access to career resources and services is a social justice issue (Sampson, Dozier, & Colvin, 2011; Sampson, McClain, Musch, & Reardon, 2011), as is access to career assessments (Sampson, 2009). Qualitative career assessments are more oriented toward social justice in several ways. First, as many qualitative career assessments are available for free, the cost-prohibitive nature of commercially offered quantitative career assessments is eliminated for clients. Second, as alternative models of staffing and delivery of career services are explored (Sampson, 2009), some qualitative career assessments offer self-guided activities that can be done before or after career counseling sessions. Further, the infusion of counseling for social justice and advocacy competencies can be a part of career counseling processes (Butler, 2012; Pope & Pangelinan, 2010), as can be the promotion of prosocial values (Dik, Duffy, & Steger, 2012) and the infusion of advocacy competencies in career development programs (Gysbers, Lapan, & Cato, 2013).
