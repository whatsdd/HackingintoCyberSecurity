### Do What Contributes to the world.&#x20;

( 80,000 Hours: Find a fulfilling career that does good.: Todd, Benjamin J: 9781537324005)

Rather than “follow your passion”, our slogan for a fulfilling career is: get good at something that helps others. Or simply: do what contributes. We highlight “getting good”, because if you find something you’re good at that others value, you’ll have plenty of career opportunities, which gives you the best chance of finding a job with the other ingredients – engaging work, good colleagues, lack of major negatives, and fit with the rest of life. You can have all the other five ingredients, however, and still find your work meaningless. So you need to find a way to help others too. If you make a valuable contribution to the world first, you’ll develop passion for what you do – you’ll become more content, ambitious and motivated. To date, over 1,000 people have made major changes to their career path by following our career advice. Many switched into a field that didn’t initially interest them, but that they believed was important for the world. After developing their skills, finding good people to work with, and the right role, they’ve become deeply satisfied. Here are two more reasons to focus on getting good at something that helps others.

**You’ll be more Successful**

If you make it your mission to help others, then people will want to help you succeed. This sounds obvious, and there’s now empirical evidence to back it up. In the excellent book Give and Take, Professor Adam Grant argues that people with a “giving mindset” end up among the most successful. This is both because they get more help, and because they’re more motivated by a sense of purpose. One caveat is that givers also end up unsuccessful if they focus too much on others, and burn out. So you also need the other ingredients of job satisfaction we mentioned earlier.

**It’s the right thing to do**

The idea that helping others is the key to being fulfilled is hardly a new one. It’s a theme from most major moral and spiritual traditions:

A man’s true wealth is the good he does in this world. – **Muhammad**

Love your neighbor as you love yourself. – **Jesus Christ**

Set your heart on doing good. Do it over and over again and you will be filled with joy. – **Buddha**

Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness. – **Martin Luther King, Jr.**

What’s more, as we’ll explain in the next section, as a college graduate in a developed country today, you have an enormous opportunity to help others through your career. Ultimately, this is the real reason to focus on helping others – the fact that it’ll make you more personally fulfilled is just a bonus.
