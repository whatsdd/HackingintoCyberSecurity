### Influences from Mainstream Culture

Individuals in the United States work within a society that transmits central assumptions about work in general. For example, U.S. assumptions include “Everyone should work; Mothers should not work; All work is good; Some work is better than others; Working with one’s hands is good; Working with one’s mind is better than working with one’s hands; Education ought to result in better work; Education ought to result in better pay.” These societal assumptions shape expectations about work. The larger societal beliefs influence the perceptions of whether to work, how much to work, and which work to do. As we noted earlier, the U.S. mainstream culture emphasizes doing rather than being; has a high value on achievement; is somewhat low on tolerance for uncertainty and somewhat low on power distance, or the distance between those in authority and subordinates (Gelfand et al., 2007). These values shape policies around individual achievement, educational opportunities for all, and limited unemployment and family leave benefits. Educational policies and funding for schooling helps shape eventual career and work opportunities. For example, concerns about the science and math abilities of U.S. students relative to many other countries have led to additional funding for science, technology, engineering, and math education. The recession of 2008 and increasing globalization have also influenced how individuals make work-related choices and decisions.

### Culturally Appropriate Career Counseling Model

We argued the importance of integrating clients’ context into career counseling earlier in this chapter. In this section, we discuss a model that helps career counselors explicitly incorporate culture in counseling. The culturally appropriate career counseling model (CACCM) specifically assesses the impact of cultural variables in each step of career counseling (Figure 4.2). The CACCM is an extension of models originally proposed by Ward and Bingham (1993; Bingham & Ward, 1994).
