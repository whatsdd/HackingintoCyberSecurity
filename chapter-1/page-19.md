### 5. Directions and Implications for Career Counseling

### Goals of Counseling

The paradigm of life designing is not meant to replace earlier paradigms, in terms of the goals and purpose of career counseling, and counselors should use different paradigmatic approaches as directed by a client’s needs (Savickas, 2015). In life designing, counselors “must help clients find a way to deal with what they feel they must” (Savickas, 2011, p. 49). The counselor begins with the question “How can I be useful to you as you construct your career?” (p. 49), and uses the answer to this question to structure the initial intervention.

### Interventions

The life-designing paradigm for career counseling is described by Savickas (2015) as consisting of three phases: (a) constructing career through small stories, (b) reconstructing these “micro narratives into a macro narrative or life portrait” (p. 138), and (c) co constructing a client’s intentions that lead to the next action. He likens these three phases to a three-act drama, in which the first act introduces the character, the second act presents the core conflict and ends with an understanding that leads to a moment of truth, and the third act reveals changes prompted by the new understanding (Savickas, 2018).

### Construction

Clients may pursue career counseling when their current career narrative is disrupted or no longer provides meaning. The initial question (“How can I be useful as you construct your career?”) leads to the five-question Career Construction Interview, in which the counselor encourages the client to tell small stories (micro narratives) about how he or she has “made a self, shaped an identity, and constructed a career” (Savickas, 2015, p. 138). These stories are important to identifying themes in a client’s career story. Savickas (2018) recommends preparing the client for this interview by explaining that the questions help to tell the client’s career story.

### 6. Translate Values into Hard and Soft Skills. (What Skills Are Needed to Work in Cyber Security as a Recent Graduate?)

Cybersecurity is undoubtedly an essential aspect of the proper functioning of every business enterprise. It fundamentally acts as the nerve center to which information is recorded, stored and transferred to various personnel within the organization. With the rising cases of data breaches occurring almost every day, the war of talent in InfoSec is stronger than ever. Recent graduates can view this highly coveted opportunity as a glass-half-full scenario; you gain meaningful employment while companies harness the much-needed expertise from cybersecurity experts. Cybersecurity experts are usually handsomely compensated for their services and what you need to compete for these positions are the right skills. Every employer strives to hire cybersecurity professionals with a handful of soft and hard skills, including: Soft Skills

● Strong Research and Writing Skills Possessing strong research and writing instincts is an invaluable asset that each information security analyst must have. Such a skill comes in handy when experts execute policy creation and enforcement. This essentially means that cybersecurity staff must conduct intensive research and work with end users to understand how technology is harnessed daily.

● Collaboration One of the most important skills that a cyber security expert can possess is the ability to effectively communicate with others. This involves being able to listen to and understand the concerns of others, as well as being able to explain complex technical concepts in a way that is easy to understand. Additionally, it is important to be able to build relationships with others in the organization, as this can help to build trust and collaboration. ● Adaptability Working in cybersecurity predominantly requires having a passion for learning. You’ll need to be a lifelong student as much as a teacher. Typically, the IT threat landscape is constantly changing with new viruses, worms, and susceptible firewalls. Keeping up with the latest vulnerabilities and persistent threats can give you an edge to thrive.

● Networking Networking in terms of “getting to know you” is a critical tool that goes way beyond the technical side. It entails harnessing your social and communication skills to expand your professional contacts and connect, which is paramount in your career development.

You can also use this opportunity to tap into the experience of the professionals you connect with to cultivate your critical thinking skills and improve the organization’s performance. You also need skills necessary to express complex concepts verbally and in writing, interpersonal skills to listen actively to others, as well as good presentation skills.

### Hard Skills

● Technical Know-how This entails understanding the fine print, how and why various components work together. This includes:

&#x20;● Understanding the management and architecture of operating systems, networking and visualization software.

&#x20;● Designing and evaluating network architecture.&#x20;

● Proficiency in scripting languages and multiple programming.&#x20;

● Understanding how components work&#x20;

● Knowledge of implementation of cloud computing&#x20;

● Ability to write custom scripts providing a wide range of security alerts&#x20;

● Antivirus and antimalware knowledge

● Problem Solving

As an information security expert, diagnosing problems, modeling and analyzing data should be in your forte. This requires attention to detail and tenacity beyond compromise. Solving complex problems in a rapidly evolving environment requires grit, innovative and forward-thinking approach. A cybersecurity graduate must have:

● The ability to identify complex issues in network architecture

&#x20;● Knowledge of intrusion detection and prevention systems&#x20;

● Ability to write custom scripts providing a wide range of security alerts
