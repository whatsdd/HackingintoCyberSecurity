Young and Domene (2012) added to this historical debate by stating there is still a disconnect between career counseling and counseling for other areas of life, such as family, emotional difficulties and relationship issues” (p. 16). They pointed out that unfortunately practitioners in career counseling and counseling even have different professional identities, practices, and professional associations, which further adds to the separation. As a result, they noted, there is often failure to connect with each other and use each other’s professional literature. This separation has led some individuals to see counselors who do career counseling as active and directive because they use qualitative and quantitative assessments and information. Counselors who do personal–emotional counseling, in contrast, are seen by others as facilitative and exploratory because they focus on psychological processes, that is, on client–counselor interactions (Imbimbo, 1994). This dichotomy of views has led to the classic stereotype of career counseling as “three interviews and a cloud of dust” (Crites, 1981, pp. 49–52). It is not surprising, therefore, that career counseling does not fare well in the eyes of practitioners when compared to personal–emotional counseling, given the classic stereotype. In addition, we believe this dichotomy has caused the public to form spurious beliefs and ideas about the nature of career counseling. Amundson et al. (2009) labeled these spurious beliefs and ideas as career counseling myths:

● Career counselors have at their disposal standardized assessments that can be used to tell people which occupation they should choose.&#x20;

● Work role decisions can be made in isolation from other life roles.

&#x20;● Career counseling does not address “personal” issues.&#x20;

● Career counselors do not need extensive counseling expertise to do their work competently.&#x20;

● Career counseling does not address the client’s context and culture.&#x20;

● Career counseling is required only when a career decision must be made.&#x20;

● Career counseling ends when a career decision is made.

Contrary to the classic stereotype, we believe that career counseling belongs in the general class of counseling because it has the same intrinsic characteristics and qualities that all forms of counseling possess. It differs from the rest of the class, however, because presenting problems often focus on work and career issues, and quantitative and qualitative assessment procedures and information are used more frequently. Swanson (1995) suggested this characterization of career counseling when she defined it as “an ongoing, face-to-face interaction between counselor and client, with the primary focus on work- or career-related issues; the interaction is psychological in nature, with the relationship between counselor and client serving an important function”. As those of you who are practicing counselors know, clients presenting problems often are only a beginning point, and as counseling unfolds, other problems emerge. Career issues frequently become personal–emotional issues and family issues, and then career issues again (Andersen & Vandehey, 2012). Psychological distress is often present (Multon, Heppner, Gysbers, Zook, & Ellis-Kalton, 2001). Thoughts, emotions, and feelings are all involved. As Kidd (2004) pointed out, “We . . . need to know more about how the expression of emotion affects career development” (p. 443). Hartung (2011a) supported Kidd’s point by stating,

Emotion holds promise for providing answers to questions about the why of vocational behavior. It seems time to examine emotion’s role in career theory and practice more broadly and specifically in fostering goal directedness, shaping purpose, constructing meaning, increasing narratability, and promoting intentionality in lifecareer design.
