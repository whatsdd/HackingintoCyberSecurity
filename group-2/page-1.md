1. Career Counseling: An Overview (Career Counseling: Holism, Diversity, and Strengths 4th Edition )

Careers are person-specific and created by the choices we make throughout our lives. Careers emerge from the constant interplay between the person and the environment. They include activities engaged prior to entering the workforce and after formal activity as a worker has been completed. Careers encompass the total constellation of life roles that we play. Thus, managing our careers effectively also involves integrating the roles of life effectively. In a very real sense, careers are the manifestations of our attempts at making sense out of our life experiences. The career development process is, in essence, a spiritual journey reflecting our choices concerning how we will spend our time on Earth. —Niles & Harris-Bowlsbey, 2005, p. 30

The theory and research base of career development and the practice of career counseling has evolved and changed as the 21st century has continued to unfold. Modern normative, science-based theories such as Holland’s theory of vocational personalities and work environments continue to be useful in guiding the practice of career counseling (R. W. Lent, 2013). At the same time, there has been “a proliferation of career counseling approaches underpinned by postmodern and constructivist philosophies” (McMahon, Watson, Chetty, & Hoelson, 2012, p. 127).

The combination of modern theories and postmodern theories is stimulating a reexamination of the nature and structure of career development and the career counseling practices used to facilitate it. This reexamination is also stimulating new ways of gathering client information as career counseling unfolds. Just as important, it is giving us new ways to think about and develop hypotheses concerning client information and behavior. It is opening up new ways to apply these hypotheses to the selection of interventions used to assist clients in resolving their problems and achieving their goals. To set the stage for the rest of the book, the first part of Chapter 1 examines the nature and structure of career counseling in light of the changes occurring in career development theory building. This discussion is presented to provide a perspective and an organizer for the career counseling interventions that are described in the chapters that follow. Then, in the second part of Chapter 1, a holistic view of career development, called life career development, is described to provide a conceptual foundation and point of departure for career counseling with clients of all ages and circumstances. The chapter closes with a discussion of competencies for counselors who do career counseling. The Career Counseling Self-Efficacy Scale (O’Brien & Heppner, 1995) is presented and described.
