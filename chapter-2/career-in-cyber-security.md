As technology continues to advance, the demand for cybersecurity professionals is likely to increase. These professionals play a crucial role in protecting and securing remote, virtual, and automated jobs.&#x20;

Cybersecurity is not limited to IT helpdesk roles or the portrayal hackers in media. It is a broad field that spans many aspects of technology and offers a range of career opportunities with good pay and a relaxed work environment. It is important for professionals in this field to stay up-to-date with the latest developments, as the field is constantly evolving and changing.

With all the positives do come some negatives you will learn about within this chapter.

In this chapter, we will explore cybersecurity by breaking it down into the following sections:

* Learning about the current state of the industry
* Exploring the foundations of cybersecurity
* Understanding the pros and cons of cyber careers

**Learning about the Current State of the Industry**

Cybersecurity is a rapidly growing field due to the increasing use of technology and the corresponding emergence of new cyber threats. The concept of cyberwarfare is a relatively new phenomenon, but it is an ongoing concern for world powers. The battlespace and the soldiers have changed with the evolution of technology. As technology continues to advance and mature, it is important for professionals in the cybersecurity field to understand the evolving threat landscape and the vulnerabilities that exist in all sectors, including phone apps and smart TVs. Understanding these trends and developments can help individuals prepare for a career in cybersecurity and stay up-to-date with the latest threats and best practices for protection.

Here are some things to consider related to the cybersecurity industry:

* Hackers are becoming more advanced
* Tools for amateur hackers continue to get simpler
* Cybercrime is exploding (and it's expensive for organizations)
* Automation is the future
* Vulnerabilities are endless.

In 2020, many careers were impacted due to the global health crisis and pandemic called COVID-19, while cybersecurity jobs remained in demand. A primary reason is because everyone went from working in a controlled office space with secured networks and on-premises monitoring to working on grandma's 100/100 Wi-Fi with a default password that was 4 years old.

This new workforce left a lot of employees and companies extremely vulnerable to a cyberattack. There was a considerable increase in ransomware attacks during 2019-2020 because attackers exploited these vulnerabilities. This meant more job opportunities for penetration testers and cybersecurity professionals to protect the new remote workforce.

Cybersecurity is not going away because cybercriminals will always find more creative ways to lure their victims to "click", which keeps you in a cyber job long after your first marriage.

**Cyber Laws and Regulations**

Before we jump into the next section, we will cover some of the cyber laws that influence the overall cyber growth and impact this field.

As we are writing this book, cybersecurity laws and legislation are a sticky topic. Congressional leaders are uncertain on how to address them because they don't know how to manage the cyber growth and the World Wide Web. The threat-scape is changing quickly, making it very challenging to determine what to address. Many of the cyber laws we have today are reactionary laws, meaning something happened, then a law was developed and enacted trying to prevent it from happening again.

An example of a reactionary law is when the first significant data breach happened to Yahoo in 2016, when hackers stole approximately 500 million accounts dating back to 2014. This breach then sparked the need for data protection and next came the Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2017.

The challenge is knowing what laws you need before something happens. How can you create a law to predict something that has happened yet?

_In 2020, the average cost for a large business data breach was more than $150 million. In 2019, the average breach was only around $3.92 million._

To understand the purpose of cybersecurity regulations, we will give you a law overview to help you better understand the current state of cyber legislation.

**Exploring the Foundations of Cybersecurity**

Cybersecurity refers to the set of practices, technologies, and design principles aimed at safeguarding digital devices, systems, and sensitive information from malicious cyberattacks. It encompasses a wide range of measures and controls, from firewalls and encryption to threat intelligence and incident response, that are designed to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats.

In this section, you will gain a foundational understanding of cybersecurity, including key concepts such as risk and vulnerability. We will also explore various cybersecurity frameworks, such as the CIA Triad, NIST, ISO, and SOC2. Additionally, we will delve into the topic of threats, assets, vulnerabilities, and risks. By the end of this section, you will have a basic understanding of how cybersecurity professionals safeguard data, devices, networks, and systems against viruses, malware, hackers, and data breaches.

**Asset, Vulnerability, Risk, and Threat**

Understanding the key terms of cybersecurity is crucial for protecting your organization's assets and maintaining a strong security posture. These terms are often used together in discussing cybersecurity risks and threats.

An "**asset**" refers to anything that is important to an organization and needs to be protected, such as sensitive data, systems, and equipment. These assets can include both physical and digital elements, such as network infrastructure, servers, and laptops, as well as confidential information like financial records and personal data.

A "**vulnerability**" is a weakness in an organization's security defenses that can be exploited by a cyber attacker. Vulnerabilities can exist in software, hardware, or even in the organization's policies and procedures. Common examples of vulnerabilities include unpatched software, weak passwords, and inadequate access controls.

"**Risk**" refers to the likelihood of a successful attack occurring and the potential impact on the organization. The risk formula: Risk = Threat x Vulnerability illustrates how these two factors interact to determine the overall level of risk an organization faces. Risk management is an important part of cybersecurity strategy, which involves identifying and assessing risks, prioritizing them, and implementing countermeasures to mitigate them.

"**Threat**" refer to any potential source of harm or disruption to an organization's assets, such as cybercriminals, hackers, or even disgruntled employees. These threats can come in various forms, including malware, phishing scams, and denial-of-service attacks, and can originate from both external and internal sources. It's important for organizations to be aware of the potential threats they may face, and to put in place measures to detect and respond to them.

Understanding these key terms is an important first step in developing an effective cybersecurity strategy. With an understanding of the assets that need to be protected, the vulnerabilities that may exist in the organization, the risks these vulnerabilities pose, and the potential threats that could exploit them, organizations can take the necessary steps to strengthen their security and protect their assets.

**CYBERSECURITY TERRITORY AND ITS BORDERS:**

The territory of cybersecurity breaches encompasses all the various computers, software programs, platforms, and digital devices that connect us and our data to networks of shared information environments. To keep this realm secure and minimize the impact of breaches, a large number of cybersecurity professionals work in various capacities to harden it against attacks and ensure its resilience in the event of a successful attack. These jobs are primarily technical in nature and require specialized training and aptitude across various areas such as software, hardware, and systems.

The “territory” covers a wide range of areas:

* **Infrastructure** refers to systems that integrate both physical and digital elements, such as the electrical grid, telecommunications networks, the Internet of Things, and the ability to access computing and networking resources in the real world.
* **Systems** security encompasses the practices, tools, and protocols used to safeguard information and devices, including but not limited to cryptography, authentication, and operating system security.
* **Software** refers to the programs and applications we use for conducting business online, which must be designed to thwart intrusion, function dependably, and securely connect with hardware and operating systems, regardless of the mobile or desktop device being used.

Cybersecurity professionals can be divided into two groups, those who focus on the technical aspects of securing digital systems, and those who work to fortify the broader field of cybersecurity by developing legal and policy safeguards, studying human behavior and online habits, and implementing security procedures for individuals and organizations. The latter group, who can be thought of as "border protectors," may work in organizational or governmental roles and may need expertise in fields such as law, governance, psychology, politics, international relations, organizational dynamics, project management, and communications in addition to technical knowledge. Some of them are also involved in the front line of cyber conflicts, where they monitor systems in real-time, implement defensive measures, analyze threats, or anticipate and prevent hostile actions.

To gain a better understanding of which aspect of cybersecurity aligns with your skills and interests, explore the various job functions and roles within the field. The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education has created a framework that defines seven primary categories of work in cybersecurity. By researching these functions and comparing them to your own interests and abilities, you can determine the most suitable educational and career path within the field of cybersecurity for you.

To gain a clearer understanding of which areas of cybersecurity align with your skills and interests, investigate the various roles and functions that professionals perform in the field. The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education has developed a framework that outlines seven key categories of work within the field. By studying these functions and assessing them in relation to your own strengths and interests, you can determine the most appropriate educational and career path within cybersecurity for you.

These seven categories are:

**Where to Get the Best CompTIA Cyber Security Certifications**

Every year, over 1 million people apply for CompTIA’s certifications. That can be a lot for employers to evaluate, so we have rounded up the best CompTIA cyber security certification programs:

CompTIA A+ Certification - This program is for IT technicians and will help you gain hands-on experience with installing and repairing any PC hardware or software. This certification will also better prepare you for finding work in IT support roles. It is the most popular CompTIA certification, and the best CompTIA cyber security certification for beginners. It will help you gain the skills you need to become an IT professional in any industry.

Sub-Certifications:

CompTIA Network+ Exam - This exam focuses on networking technologies including Ethernet, Wireless networking, and network cabling. Since this certification is an introduction to networking, it is a great stepping stone between the CompTIA A+ certification and more advanced certifications that focus on networking like the CompTIA Cloud Essentials cert or Network+.

**How Long Do You Have to Study for a CompTIA Cyber Security Certification?**

The duration of a cyber security exam varies based on the certification level. All CompTIA certifications require you to study and pass an exam, but the amount of time you have to study is contingent on the certification level. That being said, since the CompTIA A+ is the most popular cyber security certification, it’s a good foundation for beginning your studies and will also require less time than other exams.

How Much Time Will You Need to Study?

The amount of time you’ll need to study is affected by how much experience you already have. If you already have networking or computer repair experience, then it will take less time to prepare for your exam than someone who has no experience at all. If you are just starting out, you will want to study a few hours a week for six weeks to get ready for the exam.

**How Much Does It Cost?**

The cost of the CompTIA A+ certification varies significantly and is dependent on your situation. If you already have the IT experience needed and are only taking the exam to refresh your skills, then it will cost less than if you are getting into IT for the first time. As with all things in life, it is always important to do your research before spending money on a quality certification program.
