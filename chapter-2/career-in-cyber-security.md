**(** [Cybersecurity Career Master Plan: Proven techniques and effective tips to help you advance in your cybersecurity career](https://www.amazon.com/Cybersecurity-Career-Master-Plan-cybersecurity/dp/1801073562/ref=sr\_1\_8?crid=39GPFAUDFZC6\&keywords=career+in+cyber+security\&qid=1649311705\&s=books\&sprefix=career+in+cyber+security%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C311\&sr=1-8\&asin=1801073562\&revisionId=\&format=4\&depth=1) **)**

Cybersecurity is the hot new career field. It might even be hotter than the Kardashians. Why, you ask? To put it simply, technology is spearheading global growth. With new technology such as artificial intelligence and machine learning comes more cybersecurity demand. It's the whole supply and demand concept you learned in high school.

While more jobs are becoming remote, virtual, or replaced by robots, how do you think they are protected and secured? Cybersecurity is more than an IT helpdesk or the hackers you see on TV. It's a broad spectrum within all aspects of technology that has made cybersecurity an upward slope for careers, which will not change anytime soon.

What we know today will drastically change from what we know 1 year from now. We know that cybersecurity professionals make great money and get to wear hoodies and flip-flops to work. With all the positives do come some negatives you will learn about within this chapter.

In this chapter, we will explore cybersecurity by breaking it down into the following sections:

* Learning about the current state of the industry
* Exploring the foundations of cybersecurity
* Understanding the pros and cons of cyber careers

**Learning about the Current State of the Industry**

Cybersecurity is rapidly growing because of emerging technology that is producing an ever-changing threat-scape.

As you may have heard in history class, history educates us about our future. This is true even within cybersecurity. The world leaders are driven by one thing, what is that? Power! How has power historically been obtained? Typically, and sometimes the most prevalent example is war. As cyber has emerged, so has a new type of warfare called cyberwar, which is ongoing.

The battlespace and the soldiers have changed. As technology emerges and grows, so have the world powers seated at the executive table. China in 2019 was the first country to send an unmanned rover to the far side of the moon. We have self-driving cars and the prediction is that in 5 years, we could take trips to Mars. Technology is growing and maturing in unimaginable ways.

Understanding why cybersecurity is advancing in all sectors to include phone apps and smart TVs will help you grasp the projected technological growth and prepare you for a cyber career. It's crucial you understand the maturing threat-scape and vulnerabilities that exist everywhere.

Here are some things to consider related to the cybersecurity industry:

* Hackers are becoming more advanced
* Tools for amateur hackers continue to get simpler
* Cybercrime is exploding (and it's expensive for organizations)
* Automation is the future
* Vulnerabilities are endless.

In 2020, many careers were impacted due to the global health crisis and pandemic called COVID-19, while cybersecurity jobs remained in demand. A primary reason is because everyone went from working in a controlled office space with secured networks and on-premises monitoring to working on grandma's 100/100 Wi-Fi with a default password that was 4 years old.

This new workforce left a lot of employees and companies extremely vulnerable to a cyberattack. There was a considerable increase in ransomware attacks during 2019-2020 because attackers exploited these vulnerabilities. This meant more job opportunities for penetration testers and cybersecurity professionals to protect the new remote workforce.

Cybersecurity is not going away because cybercriminals will always find more creative ways to lure their victims to "click", which keeps you in a cyber job long after your first marriage.

**Cyber Laws and Regulations**

Before we jump into the next section, we will cover some of the cyber laws that influence the overall cyber growth and impact this field.

As we are writing this book, cybersecurity laws and legislation are a sticky topic. Congressional leaders are uncertain on how to address them because they don't know how to manage the cyber growth and the World Wide Web. The threat-scape is changing quickly, making it very challenging to determine what to address. Many of the cyber laws we have today are reactionary laws, meaning something happened, then a law was developed and enacted trying to prevent it from happening again.

An example of a reactionary law is when the first significant data breach happened to Yahoo in 2016, when hackers stole approximately 500 million accounts dating back to 2014. This breach then sparked the need for data protection and next came the Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2017.

The challenge is knowing what laws you need before something happens. How can you create a law to predict something that has happened yet?

_In 2020, the average cost for a large business data breach was more than $150 million. In 2019, the average breach was only around $3.92 million._

To understand the purpose of cybersecurity regulations, we will give you a law overview to help you better understand the current state of cyber legislation.

**Exploring the Foundations of Cybersecurity**

What is cybersecurity? Cybersecurity defines processes, technology, and design frameworks developed to protect organizations' devices, programs, data, and other valuable assets from unauthorized access from a cyber threat.

This section will provide you with a basic understanding of cybersecurity, key terms such as risk versus vulnerability, and different cybersecurity frameworks, which include the **CIA Triad**, **NIST**, **ISO**, and **SOC2**. **Threats, assets, vulnerabilities,** and **risks** will be covered in the following section. We will explain the fundamentals of how cybersecurity professionals protect data, devices, networks, and systems from attacks from viruses, malware, hackers, and data breaches.

**Asset, Vulnerability, Risk, and Threat**

Some terms you will hear often within cybersecurity are asset, vulnerability, risk, and threat. These are key terms you should learn and know. We will cover these briefly in this section.

Here are the breakdowns:

* **Asset:** This is anything in the environment that needs to be protected, such as data, people, proprietary tools, and processes essential for business operations
* **Vulnerability:** A weakness within your organization that can be exploited, such as flaws in software code and out-of-date software.
* **Risk:** The likelihood or possibility a threat was successful in breaching your network, the risk would be the asset's total loss. The following is an example of the risk formula to identify your organization's risk: Risk = Threat x Vulnerability
* **Threat:** Anything that is trying to degrade, disrupt, or steal your asset is a threat. This would include cybercriminals or insider threats.

### How to Figure Out if a Career in Cybersecurity Could Be Right For Me? <a href="#_8mwfx06yp0e" id="_8mwfx06yp0e"></a>

**(**[https://www.securityadvisoralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cybersecurity-Career-Guide-Workbook.pdf](https://www.securityadvisoralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cybersecurity-Career-Guide-Workbook.pdf) **)**

Cyber attacks can take all kinds of forms and strike all kinds of targets. Individuals, companies, governments, schools, and more – all are vulnerable and all must work to protect themselves and their data. That means cybersecurity professionals are needed everywhere. When cyber criminals crack your password or manage to phish their way into your protected data, cybersecurity professionals get in gear. They work to identify and close down breaches in secure systems, conduct forensic investigations to track down digital intruders, and study attacks now for lessons in building stronger defenses in the future. Cybersecurity is one of the fastest-growing, most important fields of study and work in America. And it could be the right field for you.

**Working in Cyber Security.**

Now that you’ve delved into the details of specific cyber attacks, let’s take a step back and consider more generally what professionals in the field of

cybersecurity actually does.

**CYBERSECURITY TERRITORY AND ITS BORDERS**

The “territory” in which cybersecurity breaches occur – such as those you’ve just examined – consists of all the computers, software programs and platforms, and digital devices that connect us and our data to networks of shared information environments. Large numbers of cybersecurity professionals work in many different capacities to make this territory as resistant to attack and as resilient in recovery as is possible. These jobs are largely technical in nature and require training and aptitude across software, hardware, and systems areas.

The “territory” covers a wide range of areas:

* **Infrastructure** Think systems that feature physical and computer overlap, like the electrical grid, telecommunications systems, the Internet of Things, and real-world access to computing and networking facilities.
* **Systems** Practices, tools, and procedures for protecting information and devices, including cryptography, identity validation, and operating systems.
* **Software** The vehicles we use to conduct our online business, which need to resist intrusion, perform reliably, and safely interface with hardware and operating systems, on whatever mobile or desktop device we use.

Cybersecurity professionals working in these areas might be thought of as securing or “hardening” the digital territory of our lives. Other cybersecurity professionals work at a distance from these technical fields to strengthen the “borders” of cybersecurity territory. They might work in organizational or governmental capacities, crafting legal or policy safeguards, studying and guiding people’s online behaviors and habits, or developing and implementing cybersecurity procedures for individuals and organizations to follow. Some of these border protectors also work on the “front lines” of cyber conflicts, monitoring systems in real-time, implementing defensive measures, analyzing possible and real threats, or anticipating and preempting hostile actions. In these kinds of jobs, cybersecurity work can require knowledge and skills in fields like law, governance, psychology, politics, international relations, organizational dynamics, project management, and communications, in addition to the technical dimensions in play.

To get a better fix on what part of the cybersecurity landscape might best suit your skills and interests, you can investigate the different functions or roles people play in the field. The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education has developed a framework for cybersecurity careers that defines seven basic categories encompassing all the different kinds of work people do. Delving into these functions and using them as a filter for your own interests and abilities can help identify the educational and career pathway into cybersecurity that would work best for you.

To get a better fix on what part of the cybersecurity landscape might best suit your skills and interests, you can investigate the different functions or roles people play in the field. The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education has developed a framework for cybersecurity careers that defines seven basic categories encompassing all the different kinds of work people do. Delving into these functions and using them as a filter for your own interests and abilities can help identify the educational and career pathway into cybersecurity that would work best for you.

These seven categories are:

* Investigate
* Collect and Operate
* Securely Provision
* Operate and Maintain
* Analyze
* Protect and Defend
* Oversee and Govern

These categories can overlap, depending on a person’s individual skill set or an organization’s structure and needs. Cybersecurity professionals often move in and out of jobs with responsibilities spread across two or more of these categories. The chances for learning and variety can be many, throughout the entirety of any cybersecurity career.

### Cybersecurity Career Paths and Domains. <a href="#_kj8yb0431bl5" id="_kj8yb0431bl5"></a>

Like [data science](https://blog.edx.org/data-science-analytics-career-guide?hsLang=en) or supply chain management, cybersecurity career paths are non-linear; once you enter the field, your career can go in any direction. Additionally, there are many feeder roles (networking, software development, financial and risk analysis) that can lead to an entry-level cybersecurity role.

_"You can learn these competencies and then you can aggregate them together to take on more and more responsibility."_

_“When I think about \[cybersecurity] roles, they all build on top of each other,” -_ said **Aspen Olmsted**, adjunct professor at New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering and instructor for the Cybersecurity Fundamentals MicroBachelors® Program from NYUx. “For example, you could be a host systems defender, which means you're really defending a server, or you can be a network defender where you're defending the network coming in, or you can sort of build those together. You can learn these competencies and then you can aggregate them together to take on more and more responsibility.”

When you think of cybersecurity jobs, red team cybersecurity professionals or ethical hackers who attempt to break in and analyze networks and system security may come to mind. But that’s scratching the surface. Within the field, there are several subdomains and specializations, which fall mostly into two categories: security and risk management and infrastructure management.

### 1 What Skills Do I Need For Cybersecurity? <a href="#_9btz96agnl5f" id="_9btz96agnl5f"></a>

### Although cybersecurity jobs might seem hyper-technical and math-intensive, cybersecurity professionals are jacks-of-all-trades. They should be competent in both hard skills (networking, scripting, system administration) and soft skill sets (communication, creative thinking, listening). <a href="#_7a9j511kjj2k" id="_7a9j511kjj2k"></a>

_"It's the ability to constantly reinvent yourself, learn new things, and adapt to changes. That's very important for cybersecurity specialists."_

_"When you're in this field, you have to realize that what you know one day might be different or obsolete shortly thereafter,” -_ said **Jonathan S. Weissman**, senior lecturer in the Computing Security Department at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and instructor for [RITx’s MicroMasters® Program in Cybersecurity](https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ritx-cybersecurity). “It's the ability to constantly reinvent yourself, learn new things, and adapt to changes. That's very important for cybersecurity specialists.”

Core cybersecurity technical skills you need to excel in your career:

* **Networking:** Networking is the most critical cybersecurity skill. Whether you're a penetration tester or a network engineer, you should know fundamental networking concepts such as how packets travel from your computer to other computers, OSI models, etc.
* **System administration:** Cybersecurity professionals need to master system administration. For example, can you manage what happens after downloading viruses on Windows or retrieve files off of a computer without knowing the log-in information?
* **Linux:** Linux is the operating system used on most network devices and security appliances. Familiarizing yourself with Linux allows you to collect security data and perform security hardening.
* **Hacking:** The ability to think like a cybercriminal is essential to identify any flaws in networks or security tools.
* **Building virtual machines:** Cybersecurity experts must master all virtual machine platforms to run malware analysis.
* **Programming:** You don’t need to be an expert programmer to become a cybersecurity professional, but you do need to approach problems with a programmatic mindset.

_“Scripting really helps you to understand how hardware and software works. It's important, even if you don't want to be a programmer, to understand enough so you can read code,” -_ said **Olmsted**, [who also teaches in two other NYU MicroBachelors programs](https://blog.edx.org/meet-instructor-passion-databases-exploring-career-paths?hsLang=en): Computer Science Fundamentals and Intro to Databases.

### The Top Cybersecurity Jobs: From Entry-Level to Senior Level ( [The Ultimate Guide to Cybersecurity Careers](https://blog.edx.org/cybersecurity-career-guide) ) <a href="#_8e9u15jg4otf" id="_8e9u15jg4otf"></a>

There are many high-paying, dynamic full-time jobs within the cybersecurity industry. Due to the [global talent shortage](https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Research/2020/Workforce-Study/ISC2ResearchDrivenWhitepaperFINAL.ashx?la=en\&hash=2879EE167ACBA7100C330429C7EBC623BAF4E07B), many employers are offering average salaries between $70,000 and $90,000 for entry-level roles. More experienced cybersecurity professionals such as cybersecurity directors and chief information security officers (CISOs) can earn over $150,000 annually.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/0 (3)>)

With so much demand for cybersecurity professionals, now has never been a better time to get into the field. Here are some of the highest paying and most in demand cybersecurity jobs today:

1. **Cybersecurity Analyst**

A cybersecurity analyst, otherwise known as a security operations center (SOC) analyst, is an entry-level cybersecurity role focused on frontline threat detection. Cybersecurity analysts work in security operations centers and must have a diverse set of skills from malware analysis, log analysis, Wireshark, and programming. The primary responsibility of a soc analyst is monitoring network data. While considered routine, the work and experience of a soc analyst role is a great starting place to learn the basics and launch a career in cybersecurity.

If you want to become a soc analyst, you will need to earn a few cybersecurity certifications such as the CompTIA Security+ and the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).

1. **Vulnerability Assessment Analyst**

A vulnerability assessment analyst identifies vulnerabilities in IT systems, applications, and infrastructures and creates policies and strategies to reduce security risks. They often use scanners to find vulnerabilities and threats and create plans and strategies to mitigate them. Vulnerability assessment analyst positions require a few years of experience. Prospective vulnerability analysts should have a strong grasp of both Java and HTML and a few certifications such as the [Certified Ethical Hacker](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/) (CEH) and the [GIAC Web Application Penetration.](https://www.giac.org/certification/web-application-penetration-tester-gwapt)

1. **Cybersecurity Engineer**

Similar to software engineering, cybersecurity engineers build technologies that keep computer architecture safe. Their responsibility is to anticipate network vulnerabilities, which require creating firewalls, running encryption programs, and updating software.

To become a cybersecurity engineer, you need at least a few years of experience and a strong command of programming in Python, C++, Java, or Ruby. Cybersecurity engineers must be able to read computer code to identify malware.

1. **Penetration Tester**

Penetration testers, otherwise known as ethical hackers or cyber operators, are considered one of the most popular jobs in the cybersecurity field. They are responsible for analyzing and identifying vulnerabilities in network infrastructure and web applications and must document their process and findings. But don’t be mistaken—penetration testing is not an entry-level job.

### Skills & Rolls we need for a Cyber Security Career. <a href="#_mejbcqpvz13c" id="_mejbcqpvz13c"></a>

**(** [Amazon.com: Cybersecurity: The Beginner's Guide: A comprehensive guide to getting started in cybersecurity: 9781789616194](https://www.amazon.com/Cybersecurity-Beginners-comprehensive-getting-cybersecurity/dp/1789616190/ref=sr\_1\_7?keywords=cyber+security\&qid=1649394601\&s=books\&sprefix=cyber+securit%2Cstripbooks%2C562\&sr=1-7\&asin=1789616190\&revisionId=\&format=4\&depth=1) **)**

**Skills to Acquire in Cybersecurity**

Cybersecurity is one of the most dynamic careers in the job market. While it offers quite a number of career options, the skills that you need to remain relevant in the market keep changing. This is mostly because cybersecurity is reactive to changes in the cybercrime space. Therefore, when cyber criminals change tactics, cybersecurity professionals are also expected to change. For instance, a decade ago, malware removal would be a sought-after skill in the market. However, due to automation, security tools became capable of performing this task, and so that skill lost relevance. Similarly, waves of new attacks bring emphasis to some skills and remove focus from others. For instance, the WannaCry and NotPetya attacks of 2016 brought attention to cryptography skills. For a beginner in the cybersecurity industry or an expert wishing to diversify, there are numerous skills that you may want to acquire.

* **Preference of tech giants by many job seekers:** Since cybersecurity aligns with normal IT qualifications, experts in the industry are more focused on getting placements in big name companies. This leaves small and non-tech companies with few applicants. Therefore, applicants that strategically target jobs in smaller companies have a higher chance of being employed.
* **The widening skills gap:** There is an existing skills gap between experts and beginners in cybersecurity. HR managers are facing uphill tasks when hiring for higher security roles. Sometimes, job openings in cybersecurity could go for months without being filled. However, some approaches, such as training for the required positions in-house, are less than adequate to meet all organizational cybersecurity roles.
* **High turnover rates for cybersecurity positions:** This is a common problem for job roles that have a scarce supply of talents. Organizations are desperate to hire the right people, so they end up poaching employees from others and offering remuneration that is hard for other companies to beat.

All these challenges in the cybersecurity field should be enough for you to consider gaining skills that will make you one of the highly sought-after talents. Let's go over these skills in the following subsections.

**Foundation Skills**

These are skills that provide the fundamentals that cybersecurity professionals need to have. They are baseline skills that everyone in the industry must ideally possess.

**Risk Management**

Risks are the driving force behind cybersecurity. Therefore, cybersecurity professionals should be acquainted with information about risk management. As they take on some of the typical cybersecurity roles, they will be responding to some form of risk. In addition, there are some roles that will require the professionals to demonstrate the risks that are present in systems and networks to business executives in a language they understand.

**Networking**

One of the main attack surfaces that cyber criminals target is the network. Networks play key roles in organizations since they connect the computing infrastructure and allow most of the data exchange services to be carried out. Therefore, it is apparent that a professional in cybersecurity must have adequate knowledge of networking. There are several recognized bodies that train and certify people interested in learning networking.

**Situational Awareness**

Attackers are evolving in regards to the attacks and tools that they are using against organizations. This means that cybersecurity professionals must be knowledgeable of the changes in cybercrime. They should know the latest attack trends and how they can be mitigated. Situational awareness allows cybersecurity professionals to understand how to best secure the organization based on the prevalent threats at a given time.

**Toolkits**

Contrary to what is normally depicted in movies, hacking is a slow process and is highly automated. Therefore, hackers use some toolkits to perform actions. On the cybersecurity side, professionals also use some toolkits to scan for threats or to stop attacks that are in progress. Cybersecurity professionals need to know how to use some of these toolkits or any other specialized tools provided by the organization they work for.

**Roles In Cyber Security Career**

The increased concerns about cybercrime in organizations have opened up stable careers in the cybersecurity industry. Unlike a decade ago, organizations today no longer rely on network admins or IT admins to take care of the burden of cybersecurity. They have been onboarding experts that are knowledgeable in different attacks or threats, and improving the security architecture of the organization. This chapter looks at the job market so that we can find cybersecurity roles that organizations are advertising and the in-demand skills that you can learn to transit to, change to, or build your career in cybersecurity.

**General Cybersecurity Roles**

The cybersecurity industry is currently flooded with jobs. It has been reported that there are fewer people than required to fill all the roles in cybersecurity. The main roles that organizations are advertising for are covered in the following subsections.

**Penetration testers and vulnerability testers**

A career in penetration testing involves the roles of using common reconnaissance or hacking tools such as Metasploit or Wireshark to test the security stature of the organization. It will also include reviewing the code that has been used to create the systems that organizations run their operations on. The only non-existing task in this job, for many that fancy it, is writing lengthy and detailed reports of the vulnerabilities found and the fixes required.

**Cybersecurity Consultants**

Cybersecurity consultancy roles are favorable to beginners as they are a way to gain real-world experience that might be required later in permanent positions. Cybersecurity consultants are often specialized in specific roles, and so anyone pursuing this role should identify a niche they are good at.

**Cybersecurity Managers**

It is not expected that the existing system and network admins will be able to oversee the burden of cybersecurity. They might lack the expertise or be left behind by trends in cybercrime. This is why organizations are creating the position of a cybersecurity manager to oversee all cybersecurity programs on networks and systems. The roles that are played by these managers are as follows: monitor compliance with policies, ensure IT security audits are required, keep tabs on the patching or threat mitigation efforts, and manage any cybersecurity incidents. Cybersecurity managers serve as the backbone of the cybersecurity efforts of the organization, and so are expected to have a wide scope of knowledge in this field.

**Cybersecurity Analysts**

Cybersecurity analysts analyze all security incidents to obtain useful information that might be used to prevent future attacks from happening. For instance, they might trace back the path that hackers might have followed to gain access to sensitive files. It could be that the system admins are using default passwords or that one of them fell for a social engineering scam and gave out passwords. Cybersecurity analysts ensure that they provide enough information to prevent similar attacks from happening.

**Cybersecurity Engineers**

This job plays an important role in the security stature of the organization because the engineer is expected to come up with a reliable security infrastructure. This includes developing comprehensive security policies, innovative ways to prevent threats, threat mitigation or response plans, and many other security measures. The cybersecurity engineer is also expected to ensure that systems and networks cannot be breached. Therefore, all the audits, penetration tests, or security tools that are implemented rely on these inputs. Lastly, the engineer is expected to secure a buy-in from company executives for the required security tools to be acquired.

**Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs)**

The CISO role was created to give the IT department direct representation in the executive management of a company. CISOs take over the overall responsibilities of the security of the organization. They are in charge of directing operations and getting funds allocated for cybersecurity functions. They also ensure the compliance of security policies from the top down. CISO jobs are often filled by highly-learned individuals that possess both technical and management skills.

**Chief Security Officers (CSOs)**

CSOs play the most important role of ensuring the security of both the physical and digital assets that organizations own. People holding this position ensure that security investments add value to the business. They do so by putting in place measures to protect the business processes so that they are never or hardly disrupted by the many cybercrime attacks that have occasioned the digital world. CSOs ensure that organizations have effective business continuity plans to prevent a scenario where a cyber attack brings all businesses to a standstill. They also ensure that enough security tools and techniques have been implemented to prevent data, monetary, and reputation losses that may arise from a cyber attack. CSO jobs are usually reserved for the few qualified individuals that have lengthy working experiences in IT and adequate training in cybersecurity.

**Computer System Administrators**

This is not a new role in the market—it has existed for a long time. However, the demand for skills that can fill this role is going up in the market. System administrators conventionally look after the components of systems to ensure that they are working as expected. In light of cybersecurity threats, the roles in this job have increased. They include ensuring that the systems are built in a secure way, can resist common security threats, assure the security of sensitive data in case of a breach, and can continue working during attacks. System admins are mostly degree holders in IT, computer engineering, or computer science.

**Cryptographers**

Organizations are realizing the essence of safeguarding data in transmission and storage through encryption. This ensures that even if hackers are able to breach systems or intercept traffic, the information they steal will not be useful. The internet was originally not designed for security, and so it has become a burden for organizations to ensure end-to-end encryption of the information they exchange with customers. In addition to this, hackers are becoming more effective at infiltrating organizations and stealing data. They have been able to breach organizations that are thought to be highly secure. Once data is stolen, only encryption can make it unusable. This is why organizations are employing experts that can reliably encrypt data, emails, and internet connections. Cryptographers provide these services using the most practical encryption algorithms for each functionality. Cryptographers commonly have a degree in computer science and an added certification in cryptography.

**Computer Forensic Experts**

Computer forensic experts, just like other forensic experts, are called upon to investigate cybercrime incidences. They can identify the causes of the incidents, capture evidence that can be used in a court of law, or recover information that has been lost to hackers. Computer forensics includes lots of digital data that might be fragile to handle, especially when it is intended to be used in court. Therefore, these experts sometimes work in conjunction with professions in law. Forensic experts can reliably track where stolen data or cash has been transferred to, and so they can initiate recovery efforts. They have been known to even go through listings on several black markets and pose as buyers of stolen data as part of the efforts to recover it. Outside corporate employment, computer forensic experts can be consulted in criminal cases to examine scenes of digital crime. A typical computer forensic expert will have taken a degree course in forensics and be certified by a recognized body.

**Network Security Engineers**

Network security engineers are specialized in offering security solutions to networks. Their roles, therefore, revolve around WAN, LAN, and servers. They are responsible for implementing several network tools such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. They will work toward ensuring that an organization has adequate perimeter security systems to prevent attacks. They also administer critical hardware on networks such as routers and switches to ensure that they are not compromised and offer reliable services at all times. Most network security engineers will be educated in networking and certified in network security.

**Information Assurance Technicians**

Information is critical in the digital world. However, it is increasingly being targeted by cyber criminals. The focus of cybersecurity is to protect the CIA triad of information. This triad is composed of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Information assurance technicians share the same focus. They ensure that information is always availed where needed and when needed by putting up measures for information risk management. This risk management entails all risk vectors in activities related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information.

**Data Security Analysts**

The data security analyst position is an entry-level one, but serves some sensitive roles in the organization. Due to the cybercrime scare, many organizations will have hired consultants to find out their vulnerabilities or audit their security systems and present their findings. There needs to be an expert to reconcile the reports from several assessments into an actionable plan to ensure that the network, systems, and data are secure. Additionally, organizations need someone who can continually monitor systems for security incidents and responses when needed. Sensitive data needs to be afforded extra protection, and its availability should also be assured. Therefore, there should be someone to secure the data so that it is secure during espionage attacks. There should also be someone to offer multiple redundancies if the availability of some data that's used for routine operations is required. Data security analysts play these roles, among many others. They will be indispensable responders to cyber attacks to ensure that the organization's data is secure.

**IT Security Compliance Analysts**

Cybercrime incidents are expensive to organizations, and not just because they involve the theft of cash. Cyber breaches come bundled with the unfortunate consequences of fines for not securing personal information or not following the prescribed regulations regarding data security and disclosure of attacks to users. Companies are being fined millions. Regulatory bodies are also increasingly coming up with more stringent policies that have to be complied with. Lastly, organizations often pay much attention to the development of security policies that are aimed at reducing threat exposure and aiding in response and recovery processes. However, very little focus is paid to the adherence to these policies. IT security compliance analysts provide the needed assistance in ensuring compliance with both internal and external security policies. Internally, they ensure that employees are adhering to security policies. They might come up with measures to track and reward compliance or non-compliance.

**System Security Specialists**

System security specialists are computer hardware and software experts that are specialized in cybersecurity. They play diverse roles in an organization to ensure security. It is noteworthy that security encompasses both physical and digital threats. Therefore, physical theft of a server is as much of a cyber threat today as is a denial of service attack. System security specialists ensure the physical security of digital assets in an organization such as servers and workstations. They also test the security measures that have been put in place to secure them, such as fire detectors, key-card access systems for servers, and other measures. These specialists are also called upon to implement security patches and test software to ensure that they are secure from initially identified threats. They also do independent assessments of the vulnerabilities faced by computers and computer systems. They can, therefore, use the common tools that are used to identify vulnerabilities in systems. System security specialists also ensure that critical systems have redundancies that can be activated during attacks to ensure business operations do not come to a standstill.

### CompTIA, the best Cyber Security Certifications to Boost Your Career. <a href="#_9aspk0lfud01" id="_9aspk0lfud01"></a>

**(** [CYBER SECURITY FOR BEGINNERS: A COMPREHENSIVE AND ESSENTIAL GUIDE FOR EVERY NOVICE TO UNDERSTAND AND MASTER CYBERSECURITY eBook : Smith, Liam: Kindle Store](https://www.amazon.com/CYBER-SECURITY-BEGINNERS-COMPREHENSIVE-CYBERSECURITY-ebook/dp/B09S22HW9N/ref=sr\_1\_1?keywords=cyber+security\&qid=1649394601\&s=books\&sprefix=cyber+securit%2Cstripbooks%2C562\&sr=1-1\&asin=B09S22HW9N\&revisionId=9d16ccfa\&format=1\&depth=1) **)**

The cyber security industry is exploding. According to a recent report from Cybersecurity Ventures, “the job market in cyber security is expected to reach 3.5 million unfilled positions by 2021.” These unfilled positions will likely be due to a significant gap between education and skills the market needs in the future.

**Reasons Why Choose CompTIA Certifications**

Here are four reasons why cyber security certifications from CompTIA are great ways to get ahead of this trend:

* Cyber Security Certifications Can Be Used to Show Off Your Current Skills (and Impress a Potential Employer!)

If you already have a few years of experience in the cyber security field, having a cyber security certification shows that you are staying up-to-date with the latest trends. This can be invaluable in a competitive hiring market when an employer has plenty of candidates to choose from. Additionally, if you are just starting out in cyber security, having one or more certifications can show that you have an established foundation on which to build a career.

* They Can Boost Your Salary

A 2015 report by Cybersecurity Ventures found that salaries for people in the cyber security field jumped an average of 28% between 2014 and 2015. This is definitely a trend worth jumping on, but to get ahead of this trend, you need a way to stand out from the crowd. If you have a CompTIA certification, you can show that you know state-of-the-art skills and are getting ahead at a faster pace than the industry average.

* They Can Help You Get Hired Faster

In addition to showing employers how skilled you are, cyber security certifications can help employers see your potential for future growth. This could be the difference between being hired and passing over in an interview, or being hired and becoming an invaluable asset to the company.

* They Build Your Professional Reputation

When you have a professional reputation, it is easier to land jobs and contracts. Having a CompTIA certification shows that you have taken the time to explore the latest trends in technology and security. Furthermore, when you have many of these certifications, they help your employer learn more about who you are as a person. This is important because it shows them that in addition to being a talented technician, you are a person of integrity.

**Where to Get the Best CompTIA Cyber Security Certifications**

Every year, over 1 million people apply for CompTIA’s certifications. That can be a lot for employers to evaluate, so we have rounded up the best CompTIA cyber security certification programs:

CompTIA A+ Certification - This program is for IT technicians and will help you gain hands-on experience with installing and repairing any PC hardware or software. This certification will also better prepare you for finding work in IT support roles. It is the most popular CompTIA certification, and the best CompTIA cyber security certification for beginners. It will help you gain the skills you need to become an IT professional in any industry.

Sub-Certifications:

CompTIA Network+ Exam - This exam focuses on networking technologies including Ethernet, Wireless networking, and network cabling. Since this certification is an introduction to networking, it is a great stepping stone between the CompTIA A+ certification and more advanced certifications that focus on networking like the CompTIA Cloud Essentials cert or Network+.

**How Long Do You Have to Study for a CompTIA Cyber Security Certification?**

The duration of a cyber security exam varies based on the certification level. All CompTIA certifications require you to study and pass an exam, but the amount of time you have to study is contingent on the certification level. That being said, since the CompTIA A+ is the most popular cyber security certification, it’s a good foundation for beginning your studies and will also require less time than other exams.

How Much Time Will You Need to Study?

The amount of time you’ll need to study is affected by how much experience you already have. If you already have networking or computer repair experience, then it will take less time to prepare for your exam than someone who has no experience at all. If you are just starting out, you will want to study a few hours a week for six weeks to get ready for the exam.

**How Much Does It Cost?**

The cost of the CompTIA A+ certification varies significantly and is dependent on your situation. If you already have the IT experience needed and are only taking the exam to refresh your skills, then it will cost less than if you are getting into IT for the first time. As with all things in life, it is always important to do your research before spending money on a quality certification program.
