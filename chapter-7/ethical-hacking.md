### An Introduction to Ethical Hacking. <a href="#_xe3zvxhir6zv" id="_xe3zvxhir6zv"></a>

This book focuses solely on ethical hacking. It will detail how you can use different techniques to test your system or network for any vulnerabilities and then fix those vulnerabilities before a cracker exploits them. Most people misuse the word “ethical”, often not understanding what it even means. The definition given in the Merriam Webster dictionary suits the purpose of this book. An ethical hacker can perform the different tests mentioned in the book once the system owner gives him or her permission to perform the hack.

**How Do Hackers Beget Ethical Hackers?**

Everyone has heard about hackers, and many people have even suffered losses because of the actions of a hacker. So, who is a hacker, and why is it important for people to learn more about what a hacker does? The next few sections in the book will help you understand the process of hacking and the different types of hackers in the industry.

**Who Is a Hacker?**

The word “hacker” can be defined in two ways. A hacker is someone who tinkers with software and electronic systems to understand how they work. They also look for ways to improve the functioning of a network and electronic system. They love the challenge of discovering new ways to make systems work. In recent times, the term “hacker” has taken on a new meaning. Hackers are people who want to break into a system or network for malicious purposes. These hackers are called crackers or criminal hackers. A cracker will only break into a system or network to steal, delete or modify some confidential information, which can lead to huge losses for an organization or individual.

This book will use the terms “hacker” and “ethical hacker”, so it’s important that you understand what each means and that they differ from one another. A hacker is someone who attacks a system with malicious intent, while an ethical hacker will attack a system to test and fix the vulnerabilities.

An ethical hacker, or a white hat hacker, does not like to be called a hacker because people perceive the word negatively. Crackers claim that they are only helping the system or network owner by hacking it, but that’s untrue since they are electronic thieves.

Hackers will always attack a system that they believe they can compromise. Most hackers like to attack a prestigious or well-protected system since it’s like a game for them. Also, when a hacker can attack a critical website or database, his or her status will increase in the hacker circle.

**What Is Ethical Hacking?**

Every system or network must always be updated and patched to protect it from a cracker. An ethical hacker is someone who knows how to protect the system or network. An ethical hacker possesses the mindset, tools and the skills of a hacker, but this type of hacker is trustworthy as they only hack systems to run security tests.

Ethical hacking (also called penetration testing or white hat hacking) uses the same tricks, techniques and tools to test the system. The major difference is that ethical hacking is legal. This type of hacking is performed only when the owner grants the hacker permission. As mentioned earlier, ethical hacking helps the system’s owner discover the vulnerabilities in the system from a hacker’s perspective, helping to improve the system’s security. This process is one part of the risk management program, which helps the organization or the system owner enhance the system’s security. Ethical hacking backs a vendor’s claim that the products being sold by the vendor are legitimate.

If you want to hack your system the way a cracker would, you should know how they think. After all, it’s always important for you to be familiar with your enemy.

**Why Should You Hack Your System?**

You must remember that the law of averages does not work in favor of security. The number of hackers and the amount of knowledge they have is increasing by the day. If you combine that knowledge with the number of vulnerabilities in the system, there will come a time when every computer system is compromised in one way or another. Protecting your system from a cracker is important. However, this does not mean that you should only look at the general vulnerabilities that people are aware of. Once you know how a cracker works, you will know how vulnerable your system really is.

Ethical hacking helps you identify weak security practices and discover any areas needing attention. Encryption, Virtual Private Networks (VPN) and firewalls can often create a false sense of security. However, these systems only focus on traffic and viruses through a firewall, which does not affect the work of a cracker. If you want to make your systems more secure, you should carry out the attack in the same way a cracker would. This is the only way you can harden the security of your system. If you fail to identify these weaknesses, it’s only a matter of time before the system’s vulnerabilities will surface.

You should expand your knowledge in the same way a hacker does. You should think like one of them if you want to effectively protect your system. As an ethical hacker, you should understand the activities that a cracker will carry out and then identify ways to end their efforts. You must always ensure that you are aware of what you’re looking for. That being said, you cannot expect to protect your system from everything - that’s impossible. The only way you can protect your system from absolutely all threats is to unplug it and lock it up in a cupboard to ensure that it’s never touched. Let’s face it, that isn’t the best approach to secure your information. You should only learn to protect your system from common cracker attacks and other well-known vulnerabilities. Some cracker attacks are still unknown, but that doesn’t mean that you should give up on testing your system. Try to use different combinations and test the entire system instead of looking at the individual units alone. You will discover more vulnerabilities in your system when you test it as a whole.

It’s advisable that you don’t take ethical hacking too far. For example, if you don’t have too many people working in an office and don’t have an internal web server, you needn’t worry too much about an attack through the web. However, you should never forget about any malicious employees who will threaten the security of your company.

All in all, your goals as an ethical hacker should be as follows:

* Use a nondestructive approach to hack systems.
* Identify vulnerabilities and use these vulnerabilities to prove that systems need improvements.
* Apply the results and remove any vulnerabilities to improve security.

**Ethical Hacking Commandments**

There are a few commandments that an ethical hacker must abide by. If a hacker does not abide by those commandments, there will be negative consequences. In the cases that an ethical hacker doesn’t follow these commandments, the results are not beneficial.

.**Working Ethically**

In this context, the word “ethical” refers to working with high morals and principles. Regardless of whether you are performing ethical hacking tests on your system or someone hired you to test their system, you must ensure that the steps you take support the goals of the individual or organization. In other words, you cannot have a hidden agenda. You have to ensure that you are honest and never should you misuse any information you find on the system; that is precisely what crackers do

**Respecting Privacy**

You must always respect the information that you gather. All the data to which you are granted access during testing should be kept private, right from clear-text passwords to web-application log files. You should never use this information to peek into confidential information or people’s private lives. If you sense that there is an issue, you should share that information with the right person. Additionally, you should make a habit of involving other people in your process to ensure that the owner of the system can trust you.

**Not Crashing Systems**

Many people crash their systems because they don’t have a plan in mind when they begin their testing. These testers have either misunderstood the documentation or have not read it whatsoever. As a result, they don’t know how to use different tools to test the security of their systems. If you run too many tests on your system, you can create a DoS condition that causes a system lockup. You should never rush into it or assume that a specific host or network can bear the beating that the vulnerability assessment and network scanner tools dish out.

Many security assessment tools control how tests are performed on systems at the same time. These tools are handy if you need to run a test on systems during business hours. You can create a system lockout condition or lock the account by forcing someone to change their password. These people will not realize that they have agreed to lock their system.

**Advantages of Hacking**

Hacking is a useful process when you:

* Perform a penetration test to identify any vulnerabilities in the network and computer security
* Recover any lost information, mainly in the case of a lost password
* Identify protection or preventive measures that can be implemented to prevent any breaches in security
* Prevent any unauthorized access from malicious hackers

**Disadvantages of Hacking**

Hacking is a useful process when you:

* Perform a penetration test to identify any vulnerabilities in the network and computer security
* Recover any lost information, mainly in the case of a lost password
* Identify protection or preventive measures that can be implemented to prevent any breaches in security
* Prevent any unauthorized access from malicious hackers

**Disadvantages of Hacking**

If hacking is done with negative intention, it can lead to the following issues:

* Privacy violations
* Unauthorized access to private information on a system
* Denial-of-service attacks
* Massive security breaches
* Malicious attacks on the system, leading to loss of important information
* Hampering the operations of the system

### Types of Hackers. <a href="#_h4o4pmrfawz4" id="_h4o4pmrfawz4"></a>

A hacker can be placed into one of the following categories: black hat, grey hat or white hat. Each hacker is classified based on their intent. These terms are borrowed from the Old West when a good cowboy would wear a white hat while a bad cowboy would don a black hat.

**White Hat Hackers**

A white hat hacker, who is also called an ethical hacker, does not want to harm the system. His motive is to identify the weakness in any network system or computer through different vulnerability assessments and penetration testing. Ethical hacking is legal, and, in fact, many companies hire ethical hackers to find vulnerabilities.

**Black Hat Hackers**

A black hat hacker, who is also known as a cracker, is someone who wants to hack a network or a system to gain unauthorized access. This type of hacker wishes to harm the system or steal some sensitive information. Black hat hacking is illegal since the person who is hacking the system does it with bad intentions. This includes violating privacy, blocking any communication on the network, stealing corporate data, damaging systems, etc.

**Gray Hat Hackers**

A gray hat hacker is a blend of both a white hat and a black hat hacker. These hackers do not have any malicious intent but hack a network or a system merely for fun. They want to exploit the vulnerabilities in the system without actually taking permission from the owner. Usually, their goal is to inform the owner of any weaknesses and gain appreciation and/or a sum of money from them.

**Miscellaneous Hackers**

Apart from the list of hackers detailed above, there are a few other categories of hackers that should be mentioned. These include script kiddies, intermediate hackers, elite hackers, hacktivists, cyberterrorists, and hackers involved in organized crime.

**Script Kiddies**

These hackers are computer novices who use the different tools and documentation available on the Internet to perform a hack. They do not know what happens behind the scenes and only comprehend enough to cause minimal harm. They are often sloppy, so they leave digital fingerprints everywhere. These are the hackers you hear about in the news. They need very minimal skills to attack a system since they use what is already made available to them.

**Intermediate Hackers**

These hackers know just enough to cause some serious issues. They have knowledge about networks and computers and use this knowledge to carry out well-known exploits. Some intermediate hackers want to be experts at the process; if they put in some effort, they can certainly become elite hackers.

**Elite Hackers**

Elite hackers are experts. They’re the people who develop several hacking tools and write scripts and programs. Script kiddies use these very tools and programs to perform their own attacks. Elite hackers write codes to develop malware like worms and viruses. They know how to break into a system and cover their tracks or pretend that someone else was responsible for the attack. Elite hackers are secretive and only share information if they believe that their subordinates are worthy. For some lower-level hackers to be evaluated as worthy, they should possess some special information that an elite hacker can use to perform an attack on a high-profile system. Elite hackers are the worst type of hackers. However, there are not too many of them in the world when compared to the number of script kiddies.

**Hacktivists**

These hackers disseminate social or political messages through their attacks. A hacktivist always finds a way to raise awareness about a given issue. Some examples of hacktivism are the many websites that had the “Free Kevin” messages. These hacktivists wanted the government to release hacker Kevin Mitnick from prison. Some other cases include the protests against the U.S. Navy Spy Plane that collided with a Chinese fighter jet in 2001, attacks against the U.S. White House website for years, hacker attacks between Pakistan and India and messages supporting the legalization of marijuana.

**Cyberterrorists**

Cyberterrorists attack government computers or other public utility infrastructures like air-traffic control towers and power grids. They steal classified government information or crash some critical systems. Countries have started to take cyberterrorist threats seriously, ensuring that power companies and other similar industries always have information-security controls in place. These controls will protect systems from such attacks.

**Organized Crime**

Some groups of hackers can be hired to perform organized crime. In 2003, the Korean police busted one of the largest hacking rings on the Internet. This ring had close to 4,400 members. In addition to that group, the Philippine police busted a multimillion-dollar hacking ring that sold cheap phone calls made through the lines that the ring had hacked into. These types of hackers are always hired for a large amount of money.

### Ethical Hacking Terminologies. <a href="#_18w2op67fg40" id="_18w2op67fg40"></a>

This chapter briefly details some of the common and important terms that are used in the field of hacking.

**Adware**

Hackers use this software to display advertisements on a system by force.

**Attack**

Hackers perform this action to access a system and extract some sensitive data from that system.

**Back Door**

A back door, which is also referred to as a trap door, is an entry port into software or a computer. This port does not require any login information or a password, and as a result, it can bypass all security measures.

**Bot**

A bot is a type of program that is used to automate any action, thereby increasing the number of times it can be performed. This means that the bot will perform the function for a longer time when compared to a human operator. For instance, hackers use bots to call a script that can be used to create an object or send an FTP< Telnet or HTTP file at a higher rate.

**Botnet**

Botnets, which are also called zombie armies, are a group of computers that can be controlled without the knowledge of the owner. These are used to perform denial-of-service attacks or send spam.

**Brute Force Attack**

A brute force attack is possibly the simplest attack that a hacker can perform to gain access to a system or application. This attack is an automated attack, and this means that it will try different usernames and passwords repeatedly until it can access the system or application.

**Buffer Overflow**

The buffer overflow is a flaw that can be observed when a lot of data is written onto a single block of memory. This means that the memory can no longer hold onto that data.

**Clone Phishing**

Clone phishing is a type of legitimate and existing email that has a false link. This link will trick a recipient into providing some personal information that the hacker can use to disarm the system or network.

**Cracker**

A cracker is a type of hacker that modifies any software to access some features of a system, such as copy protection features.

**DoS or Denial-of-Service Attack**

A denial-of-service, or DoS, attack is used by a hacker to ensure that a network resource or server is not available to the user. This is done by suspending the services of that server or resource.

**DDoS**

DDos stands for distributed denial-of-service attack.

**Exploit Kit**

An exploit kit is a system that a hacker designs to run on some web servers. This system is used to identify any vulnerabilities in a client machine that is communicating with the web server. It will then exploit those vulnerabilities and afterwards, execute some malicious code in the system.

**Exploit**

An exploit is a part of code or a chunk of data or software that will take advantage of a vulnerability or a bug in the system and network which, in turn, compromises the security of that system or network.

**Firewall**

A firewall is a type of filter that is placed on a network. This filter helps to keep unwanted intruders away from the system or network. In addition, it will ensure that the communication between the users and systems inside the firewall are safe.

**Keystroke Logging**

Keystroke logging is a process during which a hacker tracks how the keys are pressed on the keypad. This process will help the hacker develop a blueprint of the human interface. It is often used by both black and gray hat hackers to record some passwords. A keylogger is most commonly delivered onto a system using a phishing email or a Trojan horse.

**Logic Bomb**

A logic bomb is a type of virus that is added to a system that will trigger a malicious attack if some conditions are met. A common example of a logic bomb virus is a time bomb.

**Malware**

Malware is a term that describes a variety of intrusive and hostile software, including Trojan horses, spyware, scareware, adware, virus, ransomware, worms and any other malicious programs.

**Master Program**

Master programs are those programs that black hat hackers use to transmit commands into zombie drones (explained later in the chapter). These drones carry spam attacks or denial-of-service attacks.

**Phishing**

Phishing is a fraud method where the hacker sends an email out to the target. The hacker will use this email to gather some personal or financial information from the user.

**Phreaker**

A phreaker is a normal computer hacker. These hackers often break into telephone networks and either tap the phone lines or make long-distance phone calls.

**Rootkit**

Rootkit is a software that is often malicious. A hacker designs this software to hide some processes or programs from any normal detection method. This will ensure that the rootkit is stored on a system and has privileged access to the system

**Shrink Wrap Code**

A shrink wrap code attack is a way to exploit the holes in a poorly configured or unpatched software.

**Social Engineering**

A hacker uses social engineering to deceive another person. The hacker uses this technique to acquire some personal information about the user, like credit card details or passwords.

**Spam**

Spam is an unsolicited email. This is also called junk email and is often sent to a large group of people without their consent.

**Spoofing**

Spoofing is a technique that a hacker uses to gain access to a system or network. The hacker will send a message to the computer using an IP address, and this address will indicate to the system that the message is being sent from a trusted host.

**Spyware**

Spyware is a software that’s used to gather information about an organization or person without their knowledge. This software can be utilized to send sensitive information to any entity without the consent of the customer. It can also be used to assert control over a system.

**SQL Injection**

SQL injection is an injection technique code that is written in SQL. This tool is used to attack any data-driven application. It includes some malicious SQL statements that are entered into a field in the data. An example of an SQL injection would be dumping all data into the attacker’s folders.

**Threat**

Threats are possible dangers to a system or network. These can be used by hackers to exploit a vulnerability and compromise the security of a network or system.

**Trojan**

A Trojan horse, or Trojan, is a program that is designed to look like a normal program. Differentiating between a Trojan and a regular program is difficult. This tool can be used to alter information, destroy files and steal sensitive information like passwords.

**Virus**

A virus is a piece of code or a full program that is malicious. It copies itself in the system and has a detrimental effect on it as a result. A virus can both destroy data and corrupt the system.

**Vulnerability**

A vulnerability is a weakness in the system or network that allows a hacker to compromise the security of that system or network.

**Worms**

Worms are like every other virus in the sense that it can replicate itself in the system. It only resides in the active memory but does not make any changes to the files and will only duplicate itself.

**Cross-Site Scripting**

Cross-site scripting, or XSS, is a security vulnerability that is often found in a web application. This vulnerability gives the hacker the ability to inject some script into a web page that is viewed by users.

**Zombie Drone**

A zombie drone is used by hackers as a soldier to perform malicious activity. This drone is a hijacked computer that is used by some hackers to distribute unwanted spam emails.

### Ethical Hacking Tools. <a href="#_m62xecjelf9l" id="_m62xecjelf9l"></a>

Now that you know what ethical hacking is, let’s look at some of the different tools that are available for you to use to prevent any unauthorized access to a network system or computer.

**Nmap**

Nmap, or Network Mapper, is a tool that is used for security auditing and network discovery. It is an open source tool that was designed to scan a large network. It also works well with single hosts. A network administrator is used for different tasks, including managing service upgrade schedules and network inventory and monitoring service or host uptime.

Nmap can determine the following using raw IP packets:

* The different hosts available on the network
* The operating systems that the hosts run on
* The different services offered by those hosts
* The different firewalls that the hosts use and any other characteristics

This tool can run on most operating systems, including Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.

**Metasploit**

Metasploit, another powerful exploitation tool, is a Rapid7 product. Many of the resources used can be found on the source website: www.metasploit.com . The tool has a commercial and free version and can be used with Web UI or command prompt.

You can perform the following operations using Metasploit:

* Penetration tests on small networks
* Check the vulnerability in some systems
* Discover any import or network scan data
* Run individual tests on a host or look at the different modules that one can exploit

**Burp Suite**

Burp Suite is a tool that’s used by both malicious and ethical hackers to perform a security test of any web application. This suite has different tools that work together to support the process of testing, right from the mapping to the analysis of the application’s surface. It’s often used to exploit or locate any vulnerabilities in the application. This suite is simple to use and gives an administrator full control to combine different techniques to improve testing. Burp can be configured easily, and it has different features that can help an experienced tester with their work.

**Angry IP Scanner**

Angry IP scanner is a cross-platform and lightweight port and IP address scanner. This tool can scan an IP address in any range and can be used or copied anywhere. It utilizes a multithreading approach to increase the speed of scanning. In this approach, a separate scanning thread is employed for every address. Angry IP scanner checks if an IP address is active by pinging the address, and it will then determine the MAC address and scan ports and resolve the hostname. The data that is gathered using this tool can be saved to an XML, TXT, IP-Port List or CSV file. You can gather information about any IP using this tool.

**Cain and Abel**

Cain and Abel is a tool used in Microsoft Operating Systems for password recovery. This tool helps to retrieve passwords using one of the following methods:

* Recording a VoIP conversation
* Sniffing the network
* Decoding a scrambled password
* Cracking an encrypted password using Brute-Force, Cryptanalysis and Dictionary
* Revealing a password box
* Recovering wireless network keys
* Uncovering a cached password
* Analyzing routing protocols

This is a tool that most professional penetration testers and security consultants use for ethical hacking.

**Ettercap**

Ettercap, or Ethernet capture, is a network security tool that’s used for a man-in-the-middle attack. This tool can sniff live connections, filter any content on the fly and perform other interesting activities. Ettercap has numerous features that can be used for host and network analysis and supports the dissection of protocols (both active and passive). It runs on many operating systems, including Mac OS X, Linux and Windows.

**EtherPeek**

EtherPeek is a tool that helps to simplify network analysis that is performed on a heterogeneous network environment. This is a very small tool that can be installed on any system in a few minutes. One can use this tool to sniff the traffic packets on any network and supports different protocols, including IP, AppleTalk, UDP, NBT packets, IP Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), NetBEUI, TCP and NetWare

**SuperScan**

SuperScan is a powerful tool that can be used to resolve hostnames and scan any TCP ports. It has a user-friendly interface that can be used to perform the following functions:

* Port or ping scan using a different IP range
* Scan different ports in the network using a built-in or random range
* Decipher the responses from different hosts connected to the network
* Modify the port description and list using a built-in editor
* Merge different lists to build a new one
* Connect different open ports
* Assign a helper application to a port

**QualysGuard**

QualysGuard is a suite of tools that can be used to lower the cost of compliance and simplify any security operations. This tool can automate the full area of compliance, auditing and protection for web applications and IT systems. QualysGuard can deliver some critical security intelligence and includes a variety of tools that can be used to detect, monitor and protect the network.

**WebInspect**

WebInspect is a tool used to assess an application’s security. This helps to identify any unknown and known vulnerabilities that exist in the application layer for any tool. It can also be used to check if a server has been configured correctly and helps to test the vulnerability of a system using attacks like cross-site scripting, parameter injection, directory traversal and others.

**LC4**

LC4 (formerly called L0phtCrack) is a password recovery and auditing application. This tool is used to test the strength of passwords and to sometimes recover a password on Microsoft Windows by using hybrid, brute- force and dictionary attacks. LC4 is used to retrieve lost Windows passwords, which will help to streamline the process of migration. It also assists in retrieving a lost password for an account.

**LANguard Network Security Scanner**

A LANguard network security scanner scans a network to identify the devices connected to it. It also provides some information about every node in the network. Using the LANguard network scanner, one can obtain any information about the operating system that’s used by every system connected to the network. This tool is also utilized to detect any registry issues and can provide a report in HTML format. You can obtain information regarding the NetBIOS name table, the MAC address and the user logged into the network using this tool.

**Network Stumbler**

Network Stumbler is a WiFi monitor and scanner that is used on the Windows Operating System. This tool allows a network professional to detect a wide area network. Most hackers utilize this tool to find a wireless network that is not used for broadcasting. Network Stumbler can help you verify if a network has been configured well, detect any interference between wireless networks and test the signal coverage and strength. Additionally, it can be used on any unauthorized connections.

**ToneLOC**

ToneLOC, or Tone Locator, is a program that was written in the early 90s for MS-DOS. It was used in war dialing computer programs. Through war dialing, one can scan phone numbers using a modem and dial every number that has the same area code. Malicious hackers use this tool to breach security by identifying modems that can be used to enter a network or computer system or guess a user’s account. Ethical hackers can use it to detect any unauthorized device on the computer’s network.

### Ethical Hacking Skills. <a href="#_xv1ihbfifkiq" id="_xv1ihbfifkiq"></a>

This chapter covers the ten most important skills every hacker needs to possess and consistently improve on to become a professional in the field.

**Basic Computer Skills**

You are probably laughing at this skill; however, it is extremely important for a hacker to understand the basic functions of a computer. You’ll need to learn how to use command lines in windows and also understand how to edit the registry and set the networking parameters. These may seem like simple skills, but they’re actually very difficult to master.

If you make an error in the command line, you will mess up the entire hacking process and make the system more vulnerable than it initially was. This is a skill that professional hackers build on every chance they get. They believe that there is always room for improvement. Amateurs, on the other hand, may believe they have learned everything there is to know about computers and rarely build on the knowledge they already have.

**Networking Skills**

Once you have mastered your computer skills, you’ll need to improve your skills with networking. It’s important to know how a network functions and how to tweak it to make it better. The skills mentioned in this section are important to know; DNS, NAT, subnetting, DHCP, IPv4, IPv6, and routers and switches are all things you need to know about. You can learn many of the skills addressed in this section online.

As previously mentioned, oftentimes, amateurs are unaware of the different networking skills they will need to build upon. They may learn one or two of the skills mentioned and then fumble while hacking if they come across a different network. Therefore, any hacker who wants to improve should be aware of the various networking skills they need to have.

**Linux Skills**

Hackers often use Linux as their operating system. In fact, most tools developed for hackers are only designed for the Linux operating system. Linux can help the hacker achieve his end goal, unlike Windows. So, it’s always a good idea to learn Linux. Any professional hacker should be adept at using Linux to hack into a system and identify its vulnerabilities.

**Wireshark**

Wireshark is a packet analyzer that is an open source tool. It’s used by hackers to troubleshoot any network issues, analyze software and communications protocols and also to develop certain protocols for the system. Expert hackers are versed in utilizing this analyzer to create protocols with ease for the system they are hacking into.

**Virtualization**

Virtualization is the art of making a virtual version of anything, like a server, storage device, operating system or networking resource. This helps the hacker test the attack that is going to take place before making it live. This also helps the hacker check if he or she has made any mistakes and revise the attack.

Professional hackers use this skill to enhance the effect of the hack they are about to perform. This gives them a perspective on the damage they can do to the software while protecting themselves. An amateur hacker usually does not learn how to cover his tracks. A perfect example for this is the boy from Mumbai who released an episode of Game of Thrones from season 7. Had he covered his tracks better, he would have been able to protect himself. This is why it’s important to learn all about virtualization.

**Security Concepts**

It’s vital that a hacker learns about different security concepts and understands the changes made to technology. A person who has a strong hold on security will be able to control different barriers set by the security administrators for the system they are hacking into. Learning skills like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), firewalls, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and other skills are important for hackers to learn. If you’re an amateur, it is advised that you take courses like Security +.

**Wireless Technology**

This is a technology everybody is familiar with – information is sent using invisible waves as the medium. If you are trying to hack into a wireless device, you have to understand the functioning of that device. Therefore, it’s vital that you learn the following encryption algorithms: WPA2, WPA WEP, WPS and the four-way handshake. It is also pertinent to understand the protocol connections, authentication and restrictions that surround wireless technology.

**Scripting**

This is a skill that every hacker must possess, especially the professionals. If a hacker were to use the scripts written by another hacker, he or she would be discredited for that. Security administrators are always vigilant about any hacking attempt and will identify a new tool, which will help them cope with that attack.

A professional hacker needs to build on this skill and ensure that he or she is good at scripting. Amateurs often depend on the scripts written by other hackers. They may or may not understand the script, which would land them in big trouble.

**Database**

A database helps a user store data in a structured manner on a computer that can be accessed in various ways. If a hacker wishes to hack into a system’s database, he or she would need to be adept at different databases and also understand their functioning. Databases often use SQL to retrieve information whenever necessary. Therefore, it’s important to learn these skills before you decide to hack into a database. Professional hackers always need to know their way around a database to ensure that they make no mistakes and avoid getting caught.

**Web Applications**

Web applications are software through which you can access the Internet via your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.). Over the years, web applications have also become a prime target for hackers. It is extremely advisable that you spend some time understanding the functioning of web applications, as well as the databases that back those applications.

This will help you make websites of your own either for phishing or for any other use. The skills mentioned in this chapter are most important for hackers to develop. Professional hackers work to improve these skills right from the beginning and therefore are adept at hacking into any system easily. It’s important for amateurs to build up these skills.

### Ethical Hacking Process. <a href="#_ronur7a8vh3n" id="_ronur7a8vh3n"></a>

Like every IT project, ethical hacking should always be planned. You have to determine the strategic and tactical issues in the process. Regardless of what the test is (whether it be a simple password-cracking test or a penetration test on an application on the Internet), you must plan the process.

**Formulating the Plan**

It is essential that you get approval before you begin the ethical hacking process. You have to ensure that what you are doing is known and visible to the system owners. The first step to working on the project is to obtain sponsorship. You can connect with an executive, manager, customer or even with yourself if you are your own boss. All you need is to have someone who can back you up and sign off on your plan. Otherwise, there’s a possibility that someone may call everything off, stating that they never permitted you to test the devices.

If you’re testing the systems in your office, you need a memo from your boss that gives you permission to perform them. If you are testing for a customer, you must ensure that you have a signed contract that states the customer’s approval. It is pertinent that you obtain written approval so your effort and time don’t go to waste. Also, this way, you will learn more about what you need to do to ensure that you stay out of trouble.

It’s essential to have a detailed plan, because if you make one mistake, the systems can crash. However, this doesn’t mean that you need to include the different testing procedures you intend on using. A well-defined plan or scope should include the following information:

* Which systems need to be tested
* The risks involved
* When the tests will be performed and how long they will run for
* How the tests will be performed
* How much knowledge you have about the systems
* What you’ll do if you come across a major vulnerability
* The deliverables, like security-assessment reports, high-level reporting of general vulnerabilities that the company should address and countermeasures that the organization should implement

You must always begin the testing with the most vulnerable and critical systems. For example, it is best to start with social engineering attacks or test computer passwords before you move on to more detailed issues. It’s always a good idea to have a contingency plan in mind if something goes awry. There’s a possibility that you may take the firewall down when you are assessing it, or you may close a web application while testing it; this will reduce employee productivity and system performance since the system would then be unavailable for use. There have been times when this has led to bad publicity, loss of data and loss of data integrity.

You should handle DoS and social engineering attacks carefully. You have to determine how these attacks will affect the system you’re testing and the organization. You must also carefully determine when the tests should be performed. Do you want to test during business hours? Would it be better to test the systems early in the morning or late at night to avoid affecting the production of employees? Is it ideal to involve the people in the organization to be certain that they approve of the timing?

You have to remember that crackers do not attack your system during a limited period. Therefore, you should also use the unlimited attack approach. In this approach, you can run any type of test aside from social engineering, physical and DoS tests. You should never stop with one security hole since that will lead to a false sense of security. You have to continue to test to see what other vulnerabilities you can discover. This doesn’t imply that you should continue to hack until all your systems crash. You should simply pursue the path you are on and hack until you can no longer hack the system.

One of the goals you should keep in mind when you perform these tests is to ensure that nobody detects the attack. For instance, you can perform your tests on a remote system or from a remote office when you’re trying to avoid letting system users know what you’re doing. If the users are aware of what you’re up to, it will affect the outcome as they will then be on their best behavior.

You must be confident that you understand the system well enough to perform the hack. This will help to ensure that you protect the systems when you are testing them. If you are hacking your own system, it’s not difficult to understand it. If you are hacking a customer’s system, you will need to spend some time trying to understand how the system functions. Customers will never ask you to give them a blind assessment, because people are scared of these assessments. You should base all the tests you want to perform on the customer’s needs and these assessments.

**Selecting Tools**

As with any project, you have to select the right tools if you want to complete the task successfully. That being said, you will not necessarily identify all the vulnerabilities in the system simply because you use the right tools. You must know the technical and personal limitations of your customer. Many security assessment tools generate negative outcomes and false positives. Some tests won’t locate the vulnerabilities. For example, if you perform a social engineering test or a physical-security test, it is easy to miss some weaknesses.

Certain tools focus only on specific tests, but no one tool can be used for everything. You cannot use a word processor to scan the network for any open ports, because that does not make sense. It is for this reason that you need specific tools for the test you wish to perform. Your ethical hacking efforts become easier when you have more tools at your disposal.

However, it is vital that you remember to choose the right tool for the task. You need to use tools like pwdump, LC4 or John the Ripper to crack passwords. SuperScan, which is a general port scanner, will not crack all passwords. If you want to perform an in-depth analysis of a web application, you should use tools like WebInspect or Whisker since they’re more appropriate when compared to network analyzers like Ethereal.

When you need to select the right tools for a task, you should ask for advice from other ethical hackers, or you can post your questions on online forums and decide on the best tool to use.

Another option is using security portals like SearchSecurity.com, SecurityFocus.com and ITSecurity.com, or a simple Google search, to learn more about the different tools available for your tests. Experts provide their feedback and also give insights on the different types of tests an ethical hacker can perform.

Let’s look at a list of some freeware, open-source and commercial security tools:

* Nmap
* EtherPeek
* SuperScan
* QualysGuard
* WebInspect
* LC4 (formerly called L0phtcrack)
* LANguard Network Security Scanner
* Network Stumbler
* ToneLoc

We will learn more about some of the tools listed above over the course of the book when we look at different types of hack attacks. Most people often misunderstand the capabilities of these hacking and security tools. This is because of the incorrect assumption that tools like Nmap (Network Mapper) and SATAN (Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks) have gained bad publicity.

Some of these tools are complex, and you should familiarize yourself with each before you begin to use them. Here are some ways to do just that:

* Read the online help files or the readme files for the tools.
* Go through the user guide for any commercial tool.
* Join an online or formal class to learn more about the tool.

**Executing the Plan**

You need to be patient and have enough time on your hands to perform the hack. You also have to be careful while performing the hack. An employee looking over your shoulder or a hacker in the network will always watch what’s going on, and this person will use the information they have obtained against you.

You cannot expect to perform an ethical hack when there are no crackers in the network, because that does not happen. You have to ensure that you keep everything private and quiet. This is critical when you are deriving, transmitting and storing the results of the test. You should try to encrypt these files and emails using tools like Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and others. The least you can do is to protect the files using a password.

You’re on a mission to get as much information as you can about the system you’re testing. This is what a cracker will do. You should begin with a broad perspective and then narrow your focus:

* Look for the name of the organization, computer, network system and the IP Address; this information will often be available on Google.
* Now, narrow the scope and target the systems that you’re testing. A casual assessment will turn up some information about the system, regardless of whether you are assessing web applications or physical-security.
* Narrow the focus with a critical eye and perform an actual scan. You should also perform detailed tests on the system.
* If you want to perform an attack, do it now.

**Evaluating the Results**

You should now assess the results of your hack to identify what you’ve discovered. It’s advised that you make the assumption that these vulnerabilities were never uncovered before; this is where the results count. You need more experience to evaluate the results and identify the correlation between the vulnerabilities, and then you’ll know your systems better than anybody else. This will make the evaluation process simpler going forward. The final step is to submit a formal report to your customer or to the upper management and outline your results. You must always keep both parties in the loop to show them that their money was well spent.

**Moving On**

When you have finished the ethical hacking test, you’ll need to implement the analysis and also give the customer some recommendations. This will help to ensure the security of your systems. When you run these tests, new security vulnerabilities will appear. The information systems will always change, and these will become more complex. You’ll uncover new hacker exploits and more security vulnerabilities as time goes on.

A security test is a snapshot of how secure your systems are. You should remember that things can change at any time, especially when you add a new system, apply patches or upgrade the software. That’s why it’s important to have a plan by which you perform regular tests to assess the system’s security.

### Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks. <a href="#_dsf3r6tyo6dq" id="_dsf3r6tyo6dq"></a>

[3 in 1- A Comprehensive Beginner's Guide + Complete Tips And Tricks To Ethical Hacking + Learn Penetration Testing, Cybersecurity with Advanced Ethical Hacking Techniques and Methods Kindle Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Hacking-Comprehensive-Penetration-Cybersecurity-ebook/dp/B08NCQZ61P/ref=sr\_1\_7?crid=3BMIU3O7QWDA0\&keywords=ethical+hacking+career\&qid=1649665551\&sprefix=ethical+hacking+caree%2Caps%2C591\&sr=8-7\&asin=B08NCQZ61P\&revisionId=ef7a237f\&format=1\&depth=1)

A distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attack is performed by overloading a network or server with large volumes of traffic from different users and sources. Unlike a DoS, or denial-of-service, attack where only one Internet connection and one computer is used, different Internet connections and different computers are employed during a DDoS attack.

**Types of Attacks**

A DDoS attack can be placed in one of two categories:

* Volume-based attacks
* Application layer attacks

**Volume-Based Attacks**

A volume-based DDoS attack includes ICMP floods, UDP Floods, spoofed packet floods and TCP floods. These attacks are commonly known as Layer 3 and 4 attacks. The magnitude of an attack is measured in bits per second (bps).

**UDP Flood**

A UDP flood attack is often used to flood any random port on a remote host server. This attack is performed by sending UDP packets to the server, especially to the port number 53. You can use a specialized firewall to block or filter out any malicious UDP packets of data.

**ICMP Flood**

This type of attack is similar to the UDP flood and is often used to attack a remote host by sending several ICMP echo requests. In this type of attack, both the incoming and outgoing bandwidth is used, and a large number of ping requests will slow the system down.

**HTTP Flood**

In an HTTP flood attack, the hacker will send an HTTP POST and HTTP GET request to the target system or network in large volumes. The server cannot handle these volumes, and this will lead to a denial of any additional connections from a legitimate client.

**Amplification Attack**

In an amplification attack, a hacker will request the server, website or network to generate a large response and include a DNS request for PDFs, HTTP GET requests for images, TXT records and other data files.

**Application Layer Attacks**

There are many types of application layer attacks, including DDoS attacks targeting Apache or Windows, zero-day DDoS attacks, Slowloris, and others. The goal of the hacker is to crash the web server. The magnitude of the attack is measured in requests per second.

**Slowloris**

The attacker will send numerous HTTP headers to the target network or server, but no request is ever complete. The target server will need to keep all these connections open, which will lead to an overflow in the connection pool. This will ensure that the server does not accept any additional connections.

**Application Attack**

An application attack (also known as a Layer 7 attack) is where the hacker will overload any application through search requests, excessively logging in or a large amount of database lookups. It’s hard to identify this attack since it resembles legitimate traffic.

**NTP Amplification**

In this type of attack, the hacker will exploit the NTP as it’s accessible to the public. The hacker will perform actions that aim to overwhelm the target server.

**Zero-Day DDoS Attacks**

A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw in either the application or the system that was unknown to the user, and this vulnerability has not yet been patched or fixed. There are many types of attacks that are currently being identified that explore different vulnerabilities in the system.

**How to Overcome a DDoS Attack**

There are numerous DDoS protection tools that one can use depending on the type of attack. You can prevent a DDoS by identifying the vulnerabilities in an operating system and closing them. You also must ensure that you close every port connected to your system, thereby removing the probability of unwanted access to the system. You can also hide the system behind a VPN or a proxy server.

If the DDoS attack is low, you can use a firewall to filter out all the traffic that was sent to the network for the purpose of DDoS. If the magnitude of the attack is high, you should use a DDoS protection service provider. This tool will offer a proactive, genuine and holistic approach. You should always be careful when you select a DDoS protection service provider since there are quite a few who only want to take advantage of your situation. These providers will offer you numerous services at high costs if you let them know that your system was a victim of a DDoS attack.

You should look for a DDoS protection service provider that can be used to configure the CNAME and A records for the website. You should also look for a CDN provider that can monitor and analyze the DDoS traffic and will protect your system from an attack.

Let’s assume that the IP address you’re using is AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD. You should configure the address in the following way:

* Create an “A Record” using a DNS identifier, and ensure that you keep it secret.
* Next, use the CDN provider to assign a URL to the DNS identifier.
* Lastly, use the CDN URL to create a CNAME record.

You can ask your system administrator to help you with this task and verify that you’re configuring the CDN and DNS correctly. You will now have a DNS with the following configuration:

At this time, it’s advised that you let the CDN provider handle the attack on your system. The only condition is that you do not disclose your system’s A identifier or IP address.

**Quick Fix**

A DDoS attack is one of the most prevalent attacks performed on vulnerable networks and systems. Unfortunately, there’s no way to fix this problem quickly. If the system is under an attack, you should never panic, but instead start looking at the matter step by step.
