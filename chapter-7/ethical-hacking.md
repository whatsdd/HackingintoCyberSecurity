### An Introduction to Ethical Hacking. <a href="#_xe3zvxhir6zv" id="_xe3zvxhir6zv"></a>

This book is dedicated to the topic of ethical hacking, which involves identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in systems and networks through authorized testing methods. The purpose of this book is to provide guidance on how to detect and remediate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. It is important to note that the term "ethical" is often misused, therefore the definition provided by Merriam Webster is appropriate for the context of this book. Ethical hacking is only permissible when the system owner grants permission for the testing to take place.

**Origins of Ethical Hacking:**&#x20;

Understanding Hackers The term "hacker" has a negative connotation for many, as it is often associated with cybercrime and losses suffered by individuals and organizations. In this book, we will delve into the subject of hacking to better understand what it entails and the different types of hackers in the industry. Additionally, we will explore the emergence of ethical hacking and how it has evolved from traditional hacking methods. Understanding the origins and motivations of hackers is crucial in order to effectively combat malicious activities and protect against potential threats.

**Who Is a Hacker?**

The term "hacker" can have multiple meanings. Historically, a hacker was someone who was fascinated with understanding and improving software and electronic systems, often through exploration and experimentation. However, in recent times, the term has taken on a negative connotation, referring to individuals who engage in unauthorized access to systems or networks for malicious purposes, also known as "crackers" or "criminal hackers".

This book uses the terms "hacker" and "ethical hacker" interchangeably, but it's important to note that they have distinct meanings. Hackers attack systems with the intent to cause harm, while ethical hackers, also known as "white hat hackers", test and fix vulnerabilities with the authorization of the system or network owner.

Ethical hackers may take offense to being referred to as hackers due to the negative connotation associated with the term. It's important to note that crackers, or criminal hackers, often justify their actions by claiming they are helping the system or network owner, but their actions are illegal and harmful.

Hackers will always look for ways to compromise a system, and often enjoy the challenge of penetrating high-profile or well-protected systems. In some cases, a hacker's reputation within the community can be elevated by successfully attacking a prestigious or critical website or database.

**What Is Ethical Hacking?**

Proper maintenance and updates are crucial in protecting systems and networks from malicious actors. Ethical hackers, also known as penetration testers or white hat hackers, possess the knowledge and skills to safeguard these systems. They use the same tactics and tools as a hacker, but with the legal and authorized permission of the system or network owner.

Ethical hacking is an integral part of risk management, as it allows the system owner to identify vulnerabilities from the perspective of a hacker and make necessary improvements to enhance security. It also helps to validate the legitimacy of products offered by vendors.

It's important to have an understanding of the methods and mindset of malicious hackers in order to effectively defend against them. This is why ethical hacking is an important tool for understanding and protecting against potential security threats.

**Why Should You Hack Your System?**

It's important to keep in mind that relying on the law of averages for security is not effective. As the number of hackers and their level of expertise continues to grow, it's increasingly likely that any given computer system will eventually be compromised. To protect your system, it's essential to stay aware of known vulnerabilities, but also to be mindful of the ways in which a hacker might exploit it. By understanding how a hacker thinks and operates, you can better assess the true vulnerabilities of your system.

Ethical hacking involves identifying vulnerabilities in a system by simulating an attack, similar to how a malicious hacker would. This helps to reveal any weak security practices and pinpoint areas that need improvement. While encryption, VPNs, and firewalls can provide a sense of security, they only focus on traffic and viruses passing through the firewall. To truly strengthen a system's security, it is essential to test it from the perspective of a potential attacker. If these weaknesses go undetected, it increases the likelihood of the system being compromised.

To effectively protect your system, it is important to adopt a hacker's mindset and expand your knowledge of their techniques. As an ethical hacker, your goal is to understand the methods used by malicious actors and find ways to counteract them. It's important to always be aware of what you are looking for, but it's impossible to protect a system from every potential threat. A more practical approach is to focus on defending against common attacks and known vulnerabilities. While some attacks may be unknown, it's still essential to regularly test and evaluate your system as a whole, using different combinations of methods. This will increase the chances of discovering any vulnerabilities that may exist in the system.

It's important to keep a balance when it comes to ethical hacking. While it's important to test and evaluate your system's security, it's not always necessary to go to great lengths. For example, if you have a small office with no internal web server, the risk of a web attack is relatively low. However, it's important to always be aware of potential threats from malicious insiders, such as employees who may pose a security risk to your company.

All in all, your goals as an ethical hacker should be as follows:

* Use a nondestructive approach to hack systems.
* Identify vulnerabilities and use these vulnerabilities to prove that systems need improvements.
* Apply the results and remove any vulnerabilities to improve security.

**Ethical Hacking Commandments**

As an ethical hacker, it's important to abide by certain principles to ensure that your actions align with ethical standards. Failure to do so can result in negative consequences. It is important to follow these principles to avoid any unintended negative outcomes.

**Working Ethically**

"Ethical" in the context of hacking refers to conducting tests and evaluations with integrity and high moral standards. Whether you are performing these tests on your own system or on behalf of another organization, it's essential to ensure that your actions align with the goals of the individual or organization. This means being transparent and not having any hidden motives. Additionally, any information discovered during the testing process should be handled responsibly and not misused, as this is a common tactic employed by malicious hackers.

**Respecting Privacy**

As an ethical hacker, it's important to handle all information gathered during testing with care and respect. This includes keeping all data accessed during the process, such as clear-text passwords and log files, confidential. The information should never be used to invade people's privacy or access confidential information. If any issues are detected, it is important to share them with the appropriate parties. Additionally, involving other stakeholders in the process can help to build trust with the system owner.

**Not Crashing Systems**

Many people inadvertently cause damage to their systems by not having a clear plan in place before beginning testing. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the documentation or not reading it at all. This lack of knowledge can lead to misuse of tools and cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition resulting in a system lockup. It's important to approach testing with caution and not rush into it, as well as being mindful of the capacity of the host or network to handle the tools used for vulnerability assessment and network scanning.

&#x20;Additionally, some security assessment tools have built-in controls to manage how tests are performed on systems simultaneously. These tools can be useful when testing systems during business hours, but it's important to be aware that they can also accidentally cause system lockouts or force users to change their passwords. This can cause confusion and frustration for the user.

**Advantages of Hacking**

The benefits of ethical hacking include:

* Identifying vulnerabilities in network and computer security through penetration testing.
* Recovering lost information, particularly in the case of forgotten passwords.
* Identifying and implementing protective measures to prevent security breaches.
* Preventing unauthorized access from malicious hackers.

Hacking is a useful process when you:

* Perform a penetration test to identify any vulnerabilities in the network and computer security
* Recover any lost information, mainly in the case of a lost password
* Identify protection or preventive measures that can be implemented to prevent any breaches in security
* Prevent any unauthorized access from malicious hackers

**Disadvantages of Hacking**

If hacking is done with negative intention, it can lead to the following issues:

* Privacy violations
* Unauthorized access to private information on a system
* Denial-of-service attacks
* Massive security breaches
* Malicious attacks on the system, leading to loss of important information
* Hampering the operations of the system

### Types of Hackers. <a href="#_h4o4pmrfawz4" id="_h4o4pmrfawz4"></a>

There are several different types of hackers, each with their own distinct motivations and methods. Some common types include:

**White Hat Hackers**

Also known as ethical hackers, these individuals use their hacking skills for defensive purposes, such as identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in a system or network.

**Black Hat Hackers**

These are the individuals often associated with the term "hacker," as they engage in illegal and malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information or disrupting systems.

**Gray Hat Hackers**

These hackers fall in between white hat and black hat, often identifying vulnerabilities in systems and networks but not always seeking permission before attempting to exploit them.

**Miscellaneous Hackers:**

Apart from the list of hackers detailed above, there are a few other categories of hackers that should be mentioned. These include script kiddies, intermediate hackers, elite hackers, hacktivists, cyberterrorists, and hackers involved in organized crime.

**Script Kiddies**

These are individuals who use pre-existing tools and scripts to engage in hacking activities, often with little understanding of the underlying technology.

**Intermediate Hackers**

Intermediate hackers possess a level of knowledge that allows them to cause significant damage to systems and networks. They have a basic understanding of computer systems and networks, and use this knowledge to execute common exploits. These hackers are not necessarily malicious in their intentions but can cause serious problems, They may have the desire to improve their skills and become advanced or elite hackers with the right effort and dedication.

**Elite Hackers**

Elite hackers are experts in the field, who have a deep understanding of computer systems and networks. They are often the creators of various hacking tools and scripts, which are then used by less skilled hackers, known as script kiddies. Elite hackers have the ability to develop malware such as worms and viruses, and they know how to infiltrate a system while covering their tracks and making it appear as if someone else is responsible for the attack. They are secretive and only share information with those they deem worthy. To be considered worthy by an elite hacker, an individual must possess specific information or skills that can be used to target high-profile systems. Although elite hackers are considered the most dangerous type of hacker, they are relatively few in number compared to script kiddies.

**Hacktivists**

Hacktivists are a type of hacker who use their skills to spread social or political messages through their attacks. They aim to raise awareness about specific issues, using hacking as a means to amplify their message. Examples of hacktivism include campaigns to secure the release of individuals like hacker Kevin Mitnick, protests against government actions or policies, and support for social or political causes. Hacktivist campaigns have taken many forms, from defacing websites to launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These types of hackers are known to use hacking as a tool for activism and to deliver their message to the public. Hacktivism has been a contentious topic, as it raises questions about the morality of hacking for a political cause.

**Cyberterrorists**

Cyberterrorists are hackers who target government computers and other critical infrastructure systems such as power grids, air traffic control towers, and transportation systems with the intent to steal classified information or disrupt the functioning of these systems. The goal of cyberterrorists is to cause fear and chaos among the public, and their actions can have severe consequences.&#x20;

Governments and critical infrastructure operators have begun to take cyberterrorist threats seriously by implementing security controls to protect against these types of attacks. These controls include measures such as regular security assessments, penetration testing, incident response planning and employee awareness training. These security measures are designed to detect, prevent and respond to cyber attacks and protect the systems from being compromised, to avoid severe damage and loss of lives.

**Organized Crime**

Some groups of hackers can be hired by criminal organizations to carry out illegal activities. These organized hacking groups can be quite large, with many members, and can be involved in various types of cybercrime such as identity theft, credit card fraud, and money laundering. In 2003, for example, the Korean police broke up one of the largest hacking rings on the internet, which had close to 4,400 members.

Similarly, the Philippine police also dismantled a multimillion-dollar hacking ring that sold cheap phone calls made through the lines they had hacked into. These types of hackers are often motivated by financial gain and are willing to engage in illegal activities for a large sum of money. These type of hackers are more dangerous since they are well-organized and have the resources to carry out sophisticated cyber-attacks.

### Ethical Hacking Terminologies. <a href="#_18w2op67fg40" id="_18w2op67fg40"></a>

### Ethical Hacking Skills. <a href="#_xv1ihbfifkiq" id="_xv1ihbfifkiq"></a>

This chapter covers the ten most important skills every hacker needs to possess and consistently improve on to become a professional in the field.

**Basic Computer Skills**

Having a strong understanding of basic computer functions is crucial for a hacker. This includes knowledge of command lines in windows, editing the registry, and setting networking parameters. These may seem like basic skills, but they are actually quite difficult to master.&#x20;

A mistake in the command line can disrupt the entire hacking process and make the system even more vulnerable. Professional hackers continuously strive to improve their skills, while amateurs may believe they have learned everything there is to know about computers and fail to build on their knowledge.

**Networking Skills**

Once you have a solid understanding of basic computer skills, it's important to improve your knowledge of networking. It's essential to know how networks function and how to optimize them. Skills such as DNS, NAT, subnetting, DHCP, IPv4, IPv6, and routers and switches are all important to know. Many of these skills can be learned online.&#x20;

As mentioned earlier, amateurs may lack knowledge of the various networking skills that they need to develop, and may struggle when facing different networks. Therefore, any hacker who wishes to improve their abilities should be aware of the different networking skills they need to possess.

**Linux Skills**

Many hackers prefer to use Linux as their operating system because most hacking tools are developed specifically for Linux. The flexibility of Linux allows hackers to more easily achieve their goals, compared to using Windows. Therefore, it is highly recommended for any professional hacker to have proficiency in using Linux to hack into systems and identify vulnerabilities.

**Wireshark**

Wireshark is an open-source packet analyzer tool. It is used by hackers to troubleshoot network issues, analyze software and communication protocols, and develop new protocols for a system. Skilled hackers are proficient in using this analyzer to easily create new protocols for the system they are attempting to hack.

**Virtualization**

Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of a server, storage device, operating system, or networking resource. It allows hackers to test an attack before implementing it in real life. This also allows them to identify and fix any errors in their attack plan. Professional hackers use this technique to maximize the impact of their hack while protecting themselves.&#x20;

However, amateur hackers often lack this skill and may leave traces of their actions, making themselves vulnerable to being caught. This is why it is essential for hackers to learn about virtualization and how to cover their tracks. A real-world example of this is the case of the hacker from Mumbai who leaked an episode of Game of Thrones from season 7. If he had covered his tracks better, he could have protected himself from being caught.

**Security Concepts**

It's essential for a hacker to have a thorough understanding of various security concepts and keep up with the latest advancements in technology. A hacker who has a strong understanding of security will be able to bypass security measures set by system administrators. To achieve this, learning skills such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), firewalls, Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and other related skills is crucial. For amateur hackers, it's recommended to take courses such as Security+.

**Wireless Technology**

Wireless technology is a widely recognized method of transmitting information through invisible waves. If a hacker wants to gain access to a wireless device, they must have a thorough understanding of how the device functions. This includes learning various encryption algorithms such as WPA2, WPA, WEP, WPS, and the four-way handshake. Understanding protocol connections, authentication, and restrictions surrounding wireless technology is also crucial.

**Scripting**

Scripting is a necessary skill for all hackers, particularly professionals. Using scripts written by other hackers can lead to discreditation and lack of credibility. Security administrators are always on the lookout for new tools and techniques used in hacking attempts.&#x20;

Therefore, professional hackers should develop their scripting skills and ensure they are proficient in writing their own scripts. Amateurs often rely on scripts created by other hackers, which can lead to problems if they do not fully understand the script.

**Database**

A database is a way to store data in a structured manner on a computer that can be accessed in various ways. If a hacker wants to hack into a system's database, they must have a strong understanding of different databases and their functions. Most databases use SQL to retrieve information when needed. Therefore, it's important for a hacker to learn these skills before attempting to hack into a database. Professional hackers must have a good grasp of databases to ensure they make no errors and avoid detection.

**Web Applications**

Web applications are software that allows users to access the internet through their web browser. These have become a popular target for hackers over the years. It is essential for hackers to spend time understanding the functions of web applications, as well as the databases that support them. This knowledge will help them create their own websites for phishing or other purposes.&#x20;

The skills mentioned in this section are essential for hackers to develop. Professional hackers continuously work to improve these skills, making it easier for them to hack into any system. It is important for amateur hackers to also develop these skills.

### Ethical Hacking Process. <a href="#_ronur7a8vh3n" id="_ronur7a8vh3n"></a>

As with any IT project, ethical hacking should always be well-planned. It's important to identify both the strategic and tactical aspects of the process. Whether the test is a simple password-cracking test or a penetration test on an internet-based application, it is crucial to plan the process thoroughly.

**Formulating the Plan**

It is crucial to obtain approval before starting the ethical hacking process. It's important to make sure that the system owners are aware and approve of the testing that will be conducted. Obtaining sponsorship is the first step in working on the project. This can be obtained from an executive, manager, customer, or even from oneself if you are your own boss. It is important to have someone who can support and approve your plan, as without it, the testing process may be called off, and you could be held responsible for unauthorized testing. When testing systems in an office environment, it is necessary to have a memo from your boss giving permission to perform the tests.&#x20;

For testing for a customer, it is important to have a signed contract that shows the customer's approval. Obtaining written approval will ensure that your efforts and time are not wasted, and it will also help you understand what you need to do to avoid any legal issues. It's essential to have a detailed plan as one mistake can cause the systems to crash.

However, this doesn’t mean that you need to include the different testing procedures you intend on using. A well-defined plan or scope should include the following information:

* Which systems need to be tested
* The risks involved
* When the tests will be performed and how long they will run for
* How the tests will be performed
* How much knowledge you have about the systems
* What you’ll do if you come across a major vulnerability
* The deliverables, like security-assessment reports, high-level reporting of general vulnerabilities that the company should address and countermeasures that the organization should implement

It is important to prioritize testing on the most vulnerable and critical systems first. This can include starting with social engineering attacks or testing computer passwords before moving on to more complex issues. Having a contingency plan in place is crucial in case something goes wrong during the testing process. This can help minimize the potential impact on employee productivity and system performance if a system becomes unavailable due to testing. It also helps to prevent bad publicity, data loss, and loss of data integrity.

You should handle DoS and social engineering attacks carefully. You have to determine how these attacks will affect the system you’re testing and the organization. You must also carefully determine when the tests should be performed. Do you want to test during business hours? Would it be better to test the systems early in the morning or late at night to avoid affecting the production of employees? Is it ideal to involve the people in the organization to be certain that they approve of the timing?

You have to remember that crackers do not attack your system during a limited period. Therefore, you should also use the unlimited attack approach. In this approach, you can run any type of test aside from social engineering, physical and DoS tests. You should never stop with one security hole since that will lead to a false sense of security. You have to continue to test to see what other vulnerabilities you can discover. This doesn’t imply that you should continue to hack until all your systems crash. You should simply pursue the path you are on and hack until you can no longer hack the system.

One of the goals you should keep in mind when you perform these tests is to ensure that nobody detects the attack. For instance, you can perform your tests on a remote system or from a remote office when you’re trying to avoid letting system users know what you’re doing. If the users are aware of what you’re up to, it will affect the outcome as they will then be on their best behavior.

You must be confident that you understand the system well enough to perform the hack. This will help to ensure that you protect the systems when you are testing them. If you are hacking your own system, it’s not difficult to understand it. If you are hacking a customer’s system, you will need to spend some time trying to understand how the system functions. Customers will never ask you to give them a blind assessment, because people are scared of these assessments. You should base all the tests you want to perform on the customer’s needs and these assessments.

**Selecting Tools**

As with any project, you have to select the right tools if you want to complete the task successfully. That being said, you will not necessarily identify all the vulnerabilities in the system simply because you use the right tools. You must know the technical and personal limitations of your customer. Many security assessment tools generate negative outcomes and false positives. Some tests won’t locate the vulnerabilities. For example, if you perform a social engineering test or a physical-security test, it is easy to miss some weaknesses.

Certain tools focus only on specific tests, but no one tool can be used for everything. You cannot use a word processor to scan the network for any open ports, because that does not make sense. It is for this reason that you need specific tools for the test you wish to perform. Your ethical hacking efforts become easier when you have more tools at your disposal.

However, it is vital that you remember to choose the right tool for the task. You need to use tools like pwdump, LC4 or John the Ripper to crack passwords. SuperScan, which is a general port scanner, will not crack all passwords. If you want to perform an in-depth analysis of a web application, you should use tools like WebInspect or Whisker since they’re more appropriate when compared to network analyzers like Ethereal.

When you need to select the right tools for a task, you should ask for advice from other ethical hackers, or you can post your questions on online forums and decide on the best tool to use.

Another option is using security portals like SearchSecurity.com, SecurityFocus.com and ITSecurity.com, or a simple Google search, to learn more about the different tools available for your tests. Experts provide their feedback and also give insights on the different types of tests an ethical hacker can perform.

Let’s look at a list of some freeware, open-source and commercial security tools:

* Nmap
* EtherPeek
* SuperScan
* QualysGuard
* WebInspect
* LC4 (formerly called L0phtcrack)
* LANguard Network Security Scanner
* Network Stumbler
* ToneLoc

We will learn more about some of the tools listed above over the course of the book when we look at different types of hack attacks. Most people often misunderstand the capabilities of these hacking and security tools. This is because of the incorrect assumption that tools like Nmap (Network Mapper) and SATAN (Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks) have gained bad publicity.

Some of these tools are complex, and you should familiarize yourself with each before you begin to use them. Here are some ways to do just that:

* Read the online help files or the readme files for the tools.
* Go through the user guide for any commercial tool.
* Join an online or formal class to learn more about the tool.

**Executing the Plan**

You need to be patient and have enough time on your hands to perform the hack. You also have to be careful while performing the hack. An employee looking over your shoulder or a hacker in the network will always watch what’s going on, and this person will use the information they have obtained against you.

You cannot expect to perform an ethical hack when there are no crackers in the network, because that does not happen. You have to ensure that you keep everything private and quiet. This is critical when you are deriving, transmitting and storing the results of the test. You should try to encrypt these files and emails using tools like Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and others. The least you can do is to protect the files using a password.

You’re on a mission to get as much information as you can about the system you’re testing. This is what a cracker will do. You should begin with a broad perspective and then narrow your focus:

* Look for the name of the organization, computer, network system and the IP Address; this information will often be available on Google.
* Now, narrow the scope and target the systems that you’re testing. A casual assessment will turn up some information about the system, regardless of whether you are assessing web applications or physical-security.
* Narrow the focus with a critical eye and perform an actual scan. You should also perform detailed tests on the system.
* If you want to perform an attack, do it now.

**Evaluating the Results**

You should now assess the results of your hack to identify what you’ve discovered. It’s advised that you make the assumption that these vulnerabilities were never uncovered before; this is where the results count. You need more experience to evaluate the results and identify the correlation between the vulnerabilities, and then you’ll know your systems better than anybody else. This will make the evaluation process simpler going forward. The final step is to submit a formal report to your customer or to the upper management and outline your results. You must always keep both parties in the loop to show them that their money was well spent.

**Moving On**

When you have finished the ethical hacking test, you’ll need to implement the analysis and also give the customer some recommendations. This will help to ensure the security of your systems. When you run these tests, new security vulnerabilities will appear. The information systems will always change, and these will become more complex. You’ll uncover new hacker exploits and more security vulnerabilities as time goes on.

A security test is a snapshot of how secure your systems are. You should remember that things can change at any time, especially when you add a new system, apply patches or upgrade the software. That’s why it’s important to have a plan by which you perform regular tests to assess the system’s security.

[3 in 1- A Comprehensive Beginner's Guide + Complete Tips And Tricks To Ethical Hacking + Learn Penetration Testing, Cybersecurity with Advanced Ethical Hacking Techniques and Methods Kindle Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Hacking-Comprehensive-Penetration-Cybersecurity-ebook/dp/B08NCQZ61P/ref=sr\_1\_7?crid=3BMIU3O7QWDA0\&keywords=ethical+hacking+career\&qid=1649665551\&sprefix=ethical+hacking+caree%2Caps%2C591\&sr=8-7\&asin=B08NCQZ61P\&revisionId=ef7a237f\&format=1\&depth=1)

A distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attack is performed by overloading a network or server with large volumes of traffic from different users and sources. Unlike a DoS, or denial-of-service, attack where only one Internet connection and one computer is used, different Internet connections and different computers are employed during a DDoS attack.

**Types of Attacks**

A DDoS attack can be placed in one of two categories:

* Volume-based attacks
* Application layer attacks

**Volume-Based Attacks**

A volume-based DDoS attack includes ICMP floods, UDP Floods, spoofed packet floods and TCP floods. These attacks are commonly known as Layer 3 and 4 attacks. The magnitude of an attack is measured in bits per second (bps).

**UDP Flood**

A UDP flood attack is often used to flood any random port on a remote host server. This attack is performed by sending UDP packets to the server, especially to the port number 53. You can use a specialized firewall to block or filter out any malicious UDP packets of data.

**ICMP Flood**

This type of attack is similar to the UDP flood and is often used to attack a remote host by sending several ICMP echo requests. In this type of attack, both the incoming and outgoing bandwidth is used, and a large number of ping requests will slow the system down.

**HTTP Flood**

In an HTTP flood attack, the hacker will send an HTTP POST and HTTP GET request to the target system or network in large volumes. The server cannot handle these volumes, and this will lead to a denial of any additional connections from a legitimate client.

**Amplification Attack**

In an amplification attack, a hacker will request the server, website or network to generate a large response and include a DNS request for PDFs, HTTP GET requests for images, TXT records and other data files.

**Application Layer Attacks**

There are many types of application layer attacks, including DDoS attacks targeting Apache or Windows, zero-day DDoS attacks, Slowloris, and others. The goal of the hacker is to crash the web server. The magnitude of the attack is measured in requests per second.

**Slowloris**

The attacker will send numerous HTTP headers to the target network or server, but no request is ever complete. The target server will need to keep all these connections open, which will lead to an overflow in the connection pool. This will ensure that the server does not accept any additional connections.

**Application Attack**

An application attack (also known as a Layer 7 attack) is where the hacker will overload any application through search requests, excessively logging in or a large amount of database lookups. It’s hard to identify this attack since it resembles legitimate traffic.

**NTP Amplification**

In this type of attack, the hacker will exploit the NTP as it’s accessible to the public. The hacker will perform actions that aim to overwhelm the target server.

**Zero-Day DDoS Attacks**

A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw in either the application or the system that was unknown to the user, and this vulnerability has not yet been patched or fixed. There are many types of attacks that are currently being identified that explore different vulnerabilities in the system.

**How to Overcome a DDoS Attack**

There are numerous DDoS protection tools that one can use depending on the type of attack. You can prevent a DDoS by identifying the vulnerabilities in an operating system and closing them. You also must ensure that you close every port connected to your system, thereby removing the probability of unwanted access to the system. You can also hide the system behind a VPN or a proxy server.

If the DDoS attack is low, you can use a firewall to filter out all the traffic that was sent to the network for the purpose of DDoS. If the magnitude of the attack is high, you should use a DDoS protection service provider. This tool will offer a proactive, genuine and holistic approach. You should always be careful when you select a DDoS protection service provider since there are quite a few who only want to take advantage of your situation. These providers will offer you numerous services at high costs if you let them know that your system was a victim of a DDoS attack.

You should look for a DDoS protection service provider that can be used to configure the CNAME and A records for the website. You should also look for a CDN provider that can monitor and analyze the DDoS traffic and will protect your system from an attack.

Let’s assume that the IP address you’re using is AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD. You should configure the address in the following way:

* Create an “A Record” using a DNS identifier, and ensure that you keep it secret.
* Next, use the CDN provider to assign a URL to the DNS identifier.
* Lastly, use the CDN URL to create a CNAME record.

You can ask your system administrator to help you with this task and verify that you’re configuring the CDN and DNS correctly. You will now have a DNS with the following configuration:

At this time, it’s advised that you let the CDN provider handle the attack on your system. The only condition is that you do not disclose your system’s A identifier or IP address.

**Quick Fix**

A DDoS attack is one of the most prevalent attacks performed on vulnerable networks and systems. Unfortunately, there’s no way to fix this problem quickly. If the system is under an attack, you should never panic, but instead start looking at the matter step by step.
