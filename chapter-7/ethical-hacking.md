### An Introduction to Ethical Hacking. <a href="#_xe3zvxhir6zv" id="_xe3zvxhir6zv"></a>

This book is dedicated to the topic of ethical hacking, which involves identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in systems and networks through authorized testing methods. The purpose of this book is to provide guidance on how to detect and remediate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. It is important to note that the term "ethical" is often misused, therefore the definition provided by Merriam Webster is appropriate for the context of this book. Ethical hacking is only permissible when the system owner grants permission for the testing to take place.

**Origins of Ethical Hacking:**&#x20;

Understanding Hackers The term "hacker" has a negative connotation for many, as it is often associated with cybercrime and losses suffered by individuals and organizations. In this book, we will delve into the subject of hacking to better understand what it entails and the different types of hackers in the industry. Additionally, we will explore the emergence of ethical hacking and how it has evolved from traditional hacking methods. Understanding the origins and motivations of hackers is crucial in order to effectively combat malicious activities and protect against potential threats.

**Who Is a Hacker?**

The term "hacker" can have multiple meanings. Historically, a hacker was someone who was fascinated with understanding and improving software and electronic systems, often through exploration and experimentation. However, in recent times, the term has taken on a negative connotation, referring to individuals who engage in unauthorized access to systems or networks for malicious purposes, also known as "crackers" or "criminal hackers".

This book uses the terms "hacker" and "ethical hacker" interchangeably, but it's important to note that they have distinct meanings. Hackers attack systems with the intent to cause harm, while ethical hackers, also known as "white hat hackers", test and fix vulnerabilities with the authorization of the system or network owner.

Ethical hackers may take offense to being referred to as hackers due to the negative connotation associated with the term. It's important to note that crackers, or criminal hackers, often justify their actions by claiming they are helping the system or network owner, but their actions are illegal and harmful.

Hackers will always look for ways to compromise a system, and often enjoy the challenge of penetrating high-profile or well-protected systems. In some cases, a hacker's reputation within the community can be elevated by successfully attacking a prestigious or critical website or database.

**What Is Ethical Hacking?**

Proper maintenance and updates are crucial in protecting systems and networks from malicious actors. Ethical hackers, also known as penetration testers or white hat hackers, possess the knowledge and skills to safeguard these systems. They use the same tactics and tools as a hacker, but with the legal and authorized permission of the system or network owner.

Ethical hacking is an integral part of risk management, as it allows the system owner to identify vulnerabilities from the perspective of a hacker and make necessary improvements to enhance security. It also helps to validate the legitimacy of products offered by vendors.

It's important to have an understanding of the methods and mindset of malicious hackers in order to effectively defend against them. This is why ethical hacking is an important tool for understanding and protecting against potential security threats.

**Why Should You Hack Your System?**

It's important to keep in mind that relying on the law of averages for security is not effective. As the number of hackers and their level of expertise continues to grow, it's increasingly likely that any given computer system will eventually be compromised. To protect your system, it's essential to stay aware of known vulnerabilities, but also to be mindful of the ways in which a hacker might exploit it. By understanding how a hacker thinks and operates, you can better assess the true vulnerabilities of your system.

Ethical hacking involves identifying vulnerabilities in a system by simulating an attack, similar to how a malicious hacker would. This helps to reveal any weak security practices and pinpoint areas that need improvement. While encryption, VPNs, and firewalls can provide a sense of security, they only focus on traffic and viruses passing through the firewall. To truly strengthen a system's security, it is essential to test it from the perspective of a potential attacker. If these weaknesses go undetected, it increases the likelihood of the system being compromised.

To effectively protect your system, it is important to adopt a hacker's mindset and expand your knowledge of their techniques. As an ethical hacker, your goal is to understand the methods used by malicious actors and find ways to counteract them. It's important to always be aware of what you are looking for, but it's impossible to protect a system from every potential threat. A more practical approach is to focus on defending against common attacks and known vulnerabilities. While some attacks may be unknown, it's still essential to regularly test and evaluate your system as a whole, using different combinations of methods. This will increase the chances of discovering any vulnerabilities that may exist in the system.

It's important to keep a balance when it comes to ethical hacking. While it's important to test and evaluate your system's security, it's not always necessary to go to great lengths. For example, if you have a small office with no internal web server, the risk of a web attack is relatively low. However, it's important to always be aware of potential threats from malicious insiders, such as employees who may pose a security risk to your company.

All in all, your goals as an ethical hacker should be as follows:

* Use a nondestructive approach to hack systems.
* Identify vulnerabilities and use these vulnerabilities to prove that systems need improvements.
* Apply the results and remove any vulnerabilities to improve security.

**Ethical Hacking Commandments**

As an ethical hacker, it's important to abide by certain principles to ensure that your actions align with ethical standards. Failure to do so can result in negative consequences. It is important to follow these principles to avoid any unintended negative outcomes.

**Working Ethically**

"Ethical" in the context of hacking refers to conducting tests and evaluations with integrity and high moral standards. Whether you are performing these tests on your own system or on behalf of another organization, it's essential to ensure that your actions align with the goals of the individual or organization. This means being transparent and not having any hidden motives. Additionally, any information discovered during the testing process should be handled responsibly and not misused, as this is a common tactic employed by malicious hackers.

**Respecting Privacy**

As an ethical hacker, it's important to handle all information gathered during testing with care and respect. This includes keeping all data accessed during the process, such as clear-text passwords and log files, confidential. The information should never be used to invade people's privacy or access confidential information. If any issues are detected, it is important to share them with the appropriate parties. Additionally, involving other stakeholders in the process can help to build trust with the system owner.

**Not Crashing Systems**

Many people inadvertently cause damage to their systems by not having a clear plan in place before beginning testing. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the documentation or not reading it at all. This lack of knowledge can lead to misuse of tools and cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition resulting in a system lockup. It's important to approach testing with caution and not rush into it, as well as being mindful of the capacity of the host or network to handle the tools used for vulnerability assessment and network scanning.

&#x20;Additionally, some security assessment tools have built-in controls to manage how tests are performed on systems simultaneously. These tools can be useful when testing systems during business hours, but it's important to be aware that they can also accidentally cause system lockouts or force users to change their passwords. This can cause confusion and frustration for the user.

**Advantages of Hacking**

The benefits of ethical hacking include:

* Identifying vulnerabilities in network and computer security through penetration testing.
* Recovering lost information, particularly in the case of forgotten passwords.
* Identifying and implementing protective measures to prevent security breaches.
* Preventing unauthorized access from malicious hackers.

Hacking is a useful process when you:

* Perform a penetration test to identify any vulnerabilities in the network and computer security
* Recover any lost information, mainly in the case of a lost password
* Identify protection or preventive measures that can be implemented to prevent any breaches in security
* Prevent any unauthorized access from malicious hackers

**Disadvantages of Hacking**

If hacking is done with negative intention, it can lead to the following issues:

* Privacy violations
* Unauthorized access to private information on a system
* Denial-of-service attacks
* Massive security breaches
* Malicious attacks on the system, leading to loss of important information
* Hampering the operations of the system

### Types of Hackers. <a href="#_h4o4pmrfawz4" id="_h4o4pmrfawz4"></a>

There are several different types of hackers, each with their own distinct motivations and methods. Some common types include:

**White Hat Hackers**

Also known as ethical hackers, these individuals use their hacking skills for defensive purposes, such as identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in a system or network.

**Black Hat Hackers**

These are the individuals often associated with the term "hacker," as they engage in illegal and malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information or disrupting systems.

**Gray Hat Hackers**

These hackers fall in between white hat and black hat, often identifying vulnerabilities in systems and networks but not always seeking permission before attempting to exploit them.

**Miscellaneous Hackers:**

Apart from the list of hackers detailed above, there are a few other categories of hackers that should be mentioned. These include script kiddies, intermediate hackers, elite hackers, hacktivists, cyberterrorists, and hackers involved in organized crime.

**Script Kiddies**

These are individuals who use pre-existing tools and scripts to engage in hacking activities, often with little understanding of the underlying technology.

**Intermediate Hackers**

Intermediate hackers possess a level of knowledge that allows them to cause significant damage to systems and networks. They have a basic understanding of computer systems and networks, and use this knowledge to execute common exploits. These hackers are not necessarily malicious in their intentions but can cause serious problems, They may have the desire to improve their skills and become advanced or elite hackers with the right effort and dedication.

**Elite Hackers**

Elite hackers are experts in the field, who have a deep understanding of computer systems and networks. They are often the creators of various hacking tools and scripts, which are then used by less skilled hackers, known as script kiddies. Elite hackers have the ability to develop malware such as worms and viruses, and they know how to infiltrate a system while covering their tracks and making it appear as if someone else is responsible for the attack. They are secretive and only share information with those they deem worthy. To be considered worthy by an elite hacker, an individual must possess specific information or skills that can be used to target high-profile systems. Although elite hackers are considered the most dangerous type of hacker, they are relatively few in number compared to script kiddies.

**Hacktivists**

Hacktivists are a type of hacker who use their skills to spread social or political messages through their attacks. They aim to raise awareness about specific issues, using hacking as a means to amplify their message. Examples of hacktivism include campaigns to secure the release of individuals like hacker Kevin Mitnick, protests against government actions or policies, and support for social or political causes. Hacktivist campaigns have taken many forms, from defacing websites to launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These types of hackers are known to use hacking as a tool for activism and to deliver their message to the public. Hacktivism has been a contentious topic, as it raises questions about the morality of hacking for a political cause.

**Cyberterrorists**

Cyberterrorists are hackers who target government computers and other critical infrastructure systems such as power grids, air traffic control towers, and transportation systems with the intent to steal classified information or disrupt the functioning of these systems. The goal of cyberterrorists is to cause fear and chaos among the public, and their actions can have severe consequences.&#x20;

Governments and critical infrastructure operators have begun to take cyberterrorist threats seriously by implementing security controls to protect against these types of attacks. These controls include measures such as regular security assessments, penetration testing, incident response planning and employee awareness training. These security measures are designed to detect, prevent and respond to cyber attacks and protect the systems from being compromised, to avoid severe damage and loss of lives.

**Organized Crime**

Some groups of hackers can be hired by criminal organizations to carry out illegal activities. These organized hacking groups can be quite large, with many members, and can be involved in various types of cybercrime such as identity theft, credit card fraud, and money laundering. In 2003, for example, the Korean police broke up one of the largest hacking rings on the internet, which had close to 4,400 members.

Similarly, the Philippine police also dismantled a multimillion-dollar hacking ring that sold cheap phone calls made through the lines they had hacked into. These types of hackers are often motivated by financial gain and are willing to engage in illegal activities for a large sum of money. These type of hackers are more dangerous since they are well-organized and have the resources to carry out sophisticated cyber-attacks.

### Ethical Hacking Terminologies. <a href="#_18w2op67fg40" id="_18w2op67fg40"></a>

This chapter briefly details some of the common and important terms that are used in the field of hacking.

**Adware**

Hackers use this software to display advertisements on a system by force.

**Attack**

Hackers perform this action to access a system and extract some sensitive data from that system.

**Back Door**

A back door, which is also referred to as a trap door, is an entry port into software or a computer. This port does not require any login information or a password, and as a result, it can bypass all security measures.

**Bot**

A bot is a type of program that is used to automate any action, thereby increasing the number of times it can be performed. This means that the bot will perform the function for a longer time when compared to a human operator. For instance, hackers use bots to call a script that can be used to create an object or send an FTP< Telnet or HTTP file at a higher rate.

**Botnet**

Botnets, which are also called zombie armies, are a group of computers that can be controlled without the knowledge of the owner. These are used to perform denial-of-service attacks or send spam.

Keyloggers can be hardware or software-based and are often used by cybercriminals to steal personal information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive data. Keyloggers can be installed on a computer through malware or by physically connecting a hardware keylogger to a computer.

**Logic Bomb**

A logic bomb, also known as a time bomb, is a type of malware that is designed to trigger a harmful action when specific conditions are met. A time bomb is an example of a logic bomb, which is activated at a specific date and time. Once the conditions are met, the logic bomb will execute the attack, it can be a deletion of data, corrupting a software, or activating a ransomware.

**Malware**

Malware is a term that describes a variety of intrusive and hostile software, including Trojan horses, spyware, scareware, adware, virus, ransomware, worms and any other malicious programs. Malware is often spread through email attachments, infected software downloads, and other means, it can also be spread through exploit kits and other malicious websites that can exploit vulnerabilities in a computer or mobile device

**Master Program**

**Master programs are those programs that black hat hackers use to transmit commands into zombie drones (explained later in the chapter). These drones carry spam attacks or denial-of-service attacks.............................................**

**Phishing**

Phishing is a fraud method where the hacker sends an email out to the target. The hacker will use this email to gather some personal or financial information from the user.

**Phreaker**

A phreaker is a normal computer hacker. These hackers often break into telephone networks and either tap the phone lines or make long-distance phone calls.

**Rootkit**

Rootkit is a software that is often malicious. A hacker designs this software to hide some processes or programs from any normal detection method. This will ensure that the rootkit is stored on a system and has privileged access to the system

**Shrink Wrap Code**

A shrink wrap code attack is a way to exploit the holes in a poorly configured or unpatched software.

**Social Engineering**

A hacker uses social engineering to deceive another person. The hacker uses this technique to acquire some personal information about the user, like credit card details or passwords.

**Spam**

Spam is an unsolicited email. This is also called junk email and is often sent to a large group of people without their consent.

**Spoofing**

Spoofing is a technique that a hacker uses to gain access to a system or network. The hacker will send a message to the computer using an IP address, and this address will indicate to the system that the message is being sent from a trusted host.

**Spyware**

Spyware is a software that’s used to gather information about an organization or person without their knowledge. This software can be utilized to send sensitive information to any entity without the consent of the customer. It can also be used to assert control over a system.

**SQL Injection**

SQL injection is an injection technique code that is written in SQL. This tool is used to attack any data-driven application. It includes some malicious SQL statements that are entered into a field in the data. An example of an SQL injection would be dumping all data into the attacker’s folders.

**Threat**

Threats are possible dangers to a system or network. These can be used by hackers to exploit a vulnerability and compromise the security of a network or system.

**Trojan**

A Trojan horse, or Trojan, is a program that is designed to look like a normal program. Differentiating between a Trojan and a regular program is difficult. This tool can be used to alter information, destroy files and steal sensitive information like passwords.

**Virus**

A virus is a piece of code or a full program that is malicious. It copies itself in the system and has a detrimental effect on it as a result. A virus can both destroy data and corrupt the system.

**Vulnerability**

A vulnerability is a weakness in the system or network that allows a hacker to compromise the security of that system or network.

**Worms**

Worms are like every other virus in the sense that it can replicate itself in the system. It only resides in the active memory but does not make any changes to the files and will only duplicate itself.

**Cross-Site Scripting**

Cross-site scripting, or XSS, is a security vulnerability that is often found in a web application. This vulnerability gives the hacker the ability to inject some script into a web page that is viewed by users.

**Zombie Drone**

A zombie drone is used by hackers as a soldier to perform malicious activity. This drone is a hijacked computer that is used by some hackers to distribute unwanted spam emails.

**LC4**

LC4 (formerly called L0phtCrack) is a password recovery and auditing application. This tool is used to test the strength of passwords and to sometimes recover a password on Microsoft Windows by using hybrid, brute- force and dictionary attacks. LC4 is used to retrieve lost Windows passwords, which will help to streamline the process of migration. It also assists in retrieving a lost password for an account.

**LANguard Network Security Scanner**

A LANguard network security scanner scans a network to identify the devices connected to it. It also provides some information about every node in the network. Using the LANguard network scanner, one can obtain any information about the operating system that’s used by every system connected to the network. This tool is also utilized to detect any registry issues and can provide a report in HTML format. You can obtain information regarding the NetBIOS name table, the MAC address and the user logged into the network using this tool.

**Network Stumbler**

Network Stumbler is a WiFi monitor and scanner that is used on the Windows Operating System. This tool allows a network professional to detect a wide area network. Most hackers utilize this tool to find a wireless network that is not used for broadcasting. Network Stumbler can help you verify if a network has been configured well, detect any interference between wireless networks and test the signal coverage and strength. Additionally, it can be used on any unauthorized connections.

**ToneLOC**

ToneLOC, or Tone Locator, is a program that was written in the early 90s for MS-DOS. It was used in war dialing computer programs. Through war dialing, one can scan phone numbers using a modem and dial every number that has the same area code. Malicious hackers use this tool to breach security by identifying modems that can be used to enter a network or computer system or guess a user’s account. Ethical hackers can use it to detect any unauthorized device on the computer’s network.

### Ethical Hacking Skills. <a href="#_xv1ihbfifkiq" id="_xv1ihbfifkiq"></a>

This chapter covers the ten most important skills every hacker needs to possess and consistently improve on to become a professional in the field.

**Basic Computer Skills**

You are probably laughing at this skill; however, it is extremely important for a hacker to understand the basic functions of a computer. You’ll need to learn how to use command lines in windows and also understand how to edit the registry and set the networking parameters. These may seem like simple skills, but they’re actually very difficult to master.

If you make an error in the command line, you will mess up the entire hacking process and make the system more vulnerable than it initially was. This is a skill that professional hackers build on every chance they get. They believe that there is always room for improvement. Amateurs, on the other hand, may believe they have learned everything there is to know about computers and rarely build on the knowledge they already have.

**Networking Skills**

Once you have mastered your computer skills, you’ll need to improve your skills with networking. It’s important to know how a network functions and how to tweak it to make it better. The skills mentioned in this section are important to know; DNS, NAT, subnetting, DHCP, IPv4, IPv6, and routers and switches are all things you need to know about. You can learn many of the skills addressed in this section online.

As previously mentioned, oftentimes, amateurs are unaware of the different networking skills they will need to build upon. They may learn one or two of the skills mentioned and then fumble while hacking if they come across a different network. Therefore, any hacker who wants to improve should be aware of the various networking skills they need to have.

**Linux Skills**

Hackers often use Linux as their operating system. In fact, most tools developed for hackers are only designed for the Linux operating system. Linux can help the hacker achieve his end goal, unlike Windows. So, it’s always a good idea to learn Linux. Any professional hacker should be adept at using Linux to hack into a system and identify its vulnerabilities.

**Wireshark**

Wireshark is a packet analyzer that is an open source tool. It’s used by hackers to troubleshoot any network issues, analyze software and communications protocols and also to develop certain protocols for the system. Expert hackers are versed in utilizing this analyzer to create protocols with ease for the system they are hacking into.

**Virtualization**

Virtualization is the art of making a virtual version of anything, like a server, storage device, operating system or networking resource. This helps the hacker test the attack that is going to take place before making it live. This also helps the hacker check if he or she has made any mistakes and revise the attack.

Professional hackers use this skill to enhance the effect of the hack they are about to perform. This gives them a perspective on the damage they can do to the software while protecting themselves. An amateur hacker usually does not learn how to cover his tracks. A perfect example for this is the boy from Mumbai who released an episode of Game of Thrones from season 7. Had he covered his tracks better, he would have been able to protect himself. This is why it’s important to learn all about virtualization.

**Security Concepts**

It’s vital that a hacker learns about different security concepts and understands the changes made to technology. A person who has a strong hold on security will be able to control different barriers set by the security administrators for the system they are hacking into. Learning skills like Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), firewalls, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and other skills are important for hackers to learn. If you’re an amateur, it is advised that you take courses like Security +.

**Wireless Technology**

This is a technology everybody is familiar with – information is sent using invisible waves as the medium. If you are trying to hack into a wireless device, you have to understand the functioning of that device. Therefore, it’s vital that you learn the following encryption algorithms: WPA2, WPA WEP, WPS and the four-way handshake. It is also pertinent to understand the protocol connections, authentication and restrictions that surround wireless technology.

**Scripting**

This is a skill that every hacker must possess, especially the professionals. If a hacker were to use the scripts written by another hacker, he or she would be discredited for that. Security administrators are always vigilant about any hacking attempt and will identify a new tool, which will help them cope with that attack.

A professional hacker needs to build on this skill and ensure that he or she is good at scripting. Amateurs often depend on the scripts written by other hackers. They may or may not understand the script, which would land them in big trouble.

**Database**

A database helps a user store data in a structured manner on a computer that can be accessed in various ways. If a hacker wishes to hack into a system’s database, he or she would need to be adept at different databases and also understand their functioning. Databases often use SQL to retrieve information whenever necessary. Therefore, it’s important to learn these skills before you decide to hack into a database. Professional hackers always need to know their way around a database to ensure that they make no mistakes and avoid getting caught.

**Web Applications**

Web applications are software through which you can access the Internet via your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.). Over the years, web applications have also become a prime target for hackers. It is extremely advisable that you spend some time understanding the functioning of web applications, as well as the databases that back those applications.

This will help you make websites of your own either for phishing or for any other use. The skills mentioned in this chapter are most important for hackers to develop. Professional hackers work to improve these skills right from the beginning and therefore are adept at hacking into any system easily. It’s important for amateurs to build up these skills.

### Ethical Hacking Process. <a href="#_ronur7a8vh3n" id="_ronur7a8vh3n"></a>

Like every IT project, ethical hacking should always be planned. You have to determine the strategic and tactical issues in the process. Regardless of what the test is (whether it be a simple password-cracking test or a penetration test on an application on the Internet), you must plan the process.

**Formulating the Plan**

It is essential that you get approval before you begin the ethical hacking process. You have to ensure that what you are doing is known and visible to the system owners. The first step to working on the project is to obtain sponsorship. You can connect with an executive, manager, customer or even with yourself if you are your own boss. All you need is to have someone who can back you up and sign off on your plan. Otherwise, there’s a possibility that someone may call everything off, stating that they never permitted you to test the devices.

If you’re testing the systems in your office, you need a memo from your boss that gives you permission to perform them. If you are testing for a customer, you must ensure that you have a signed contract that states the customer’s approval. It is pertinent that you obtain written approval so your effort and time don’t go to waste. Also, this way, you will learn more about what you need to do to ensure that you stay out of trouble.

It’s essential to have a detailed plan, because if you make one mistake, the systems can crash. However, this doesn’t mean that you need to include the different testing procedures you intend on using. A well-defined plan or scope should include the following information:

* Which systems need to be tested
* The risks involved
* When the tests will be performed and how long they will run for
* How the tests will be performed
* How much knowledge you have about the systems
* What you’ll do if you come across a major vulnerability
* The deliverables, like security-assessment reports, high-level reporting of general vulnerabilities that the company should address and countermeasures that the organization should implement

You must always begin the testing with the most vulnerable and critical systems. For example, it is best to start with social engineering attacks or test computer passwords before you move on to more detailed issues. It’s always a good idea to have a contingency plan in mind if something goes awry. There’s a possibility that you may take the firewall down when you are assessing it, or you may close a web application while testing it; this will reduce employee productivity and system performance since the system would then be unavailable for use. There have been times when this has led to bad publicity, loss of data and loss of data integrity.

You should handle DoS and social engineering attacks carefully. You have to determine how these attacks will affect the system you’re testing and the organization. You must also carefully determine when the tests should be performed. Do you want to test during business hours? Would it be better to test the systems early in the morning or late at night to avoid affecting the production of employees? Is it ideal to involve the people in the organization to be certain that they approve of the timing?

You have to remember that crackers do not attack your system during a limited period. Therefore, you should also use the unlimited attack approach. In this approach, you can run any type of test aside from social engineering, physical and DoS tests. You should never stop with one security hole since that will lead to a false sense of security. You have to continue to test to see what other vulnerabilities you can discover. This doesn’t imply that you should continue to hack until all your systems crash. You should simply pursue the path you are on and hack until you can no longer hack the system.

One of the goals you should keep in mind when you perform these tests is to ensure that nobody detects the attack. For instance, you can perform your tests on a remote system or from a remote office when you’re trying to avoid letting system users know what you’re doing. If the users are aware of what you’re up to, it will affect the outcome as they will then be on their best behavior.

You must be confident that you understand the system well enough to perform the hack. This will help to ensure that you protect the systems when you are testing them. If you are hacking your own system, it’s not difficult to understand it. If you are hacking a customer’s system, you will need to spend some time trying to understand how the system functions. Customers will never ask you to give them a blind assessment, because people are scared of these assessments. You should base all the tests you want to perform on the customer’s needs and these assessments.

**Selecting Tools**

As with any project, you have to select the right tools if you want to complete the task successfully. That being said, you will not necessarily identify all the vulnerabilities in the system simply because you use the right tools. You must know the technical and personal limitations of your customer. Many security assessment tools generate negative outcomes and false positives. Some tests won’t locate the vulnerabilities. For example, if you perform a social engineering test or a physical-security test, it is easy to miss some weaknesses.

Certain tools focus only on specific tests, but no one tool can be used for everything. You cannot use a word processor to scan the network for any open ports, because that does not make sense. It is for this reason that you need specific tools for the test you wish to perform. Your ethical hacking efforts become easier when you have more tools at your disposal.

However, it is vital that you remember to choose the right tool for the task. You need to use tools like pwdump, LC4 or John the Ripper to crack passwords. SuperScan, which is a general port scanner, will not crack all passwords. If you want to perform an in-depth analysis of a web application, you should use tools like WebInspect or Whisker since they’re more appropriate when compared to network analyzers like Ethereal.

When you need to select the right tools for a task, you should ask for advice from other ethical hackers, or you can post your questions on online forums and decide on the best tool to use.

Another option is using security portals like SearchSecurity.com, SecurityFocus.com and ITSecurity.com, or a simple Google search, to learn more about the different tools available for your tests. Experts provide their feedback and also give insights on the different types of tests an ethical hacker can perform.

Let’s look at a list of some freeware, open-source and commercial security tools:

* Nmap
* EtherPeek
* SuperScan
* QualysGuard
* WebInspect
* LC4 (formerly called L0phtcrack)
* LANguard Network Security Scanner
* Network Stumbler
* ToneLoc

We will learn more about some of the tools listed above over the course of the book when we look at different types of hack attacks. Most people often misunderstand the capabilities of these hacking and security tools. This is because of the incorrect assumption that tools like Nmap (Network Mapper) and SATAN (Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks) have gained bad publicity.

Some of these tools are complex, and you should familiarize yourself with each before you begin to use them. Here are some ways to do just that:

* Read the online help files or the readme files for the tools.
* Go through the user guide for any commercial tool.
* Join an online or formal class to learn more about the tool.

**Executing the Plan**

You need to be patient and have enough time on your hands to perform the hack. You also have to be careful while performing the hack. An employee looking over your shoulder or a hacker in the network will always watch what’s going on, and this person will use the information they have obtained against you.

You cannot expect to perform an ethical hack when there are no crackers in the network, because that does not happen. You have to ensure that you keep everything private and quiet. This is critical when you are deriving, transmitting and storing the results of the test. You should try to encrypt these files and emails using tools like Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and others. The least you can do is to protect the files using a password.

You’re on a mission to get as much information as you can about the system you’re testing. This is what a cracker will do. You should begin with a broad perspective and then narrow your focus:

* Look for the name of the organization, computer, network system and the IP Address; this information will often be available on Google.
* Now, narrow the scope and target the systems that you’re testing. A casual assessment will turn up some information about the system, regardless of whether you are assessing web applications or physical-security.
* Narrow the focus with a critical eye and perform an actual scan. You should also perform detailed tests on the system.
* If you want to perform an attack, do it now.

**Evaluating the Results**

You should now assess the results of your hack to identify what you’ve discovered. It’s advised that you make the assumption that these vulnerabilities were never uncovered before; this is where the results count. You need more experience to evaluate the results and identify the correlation between the vulnerabilities, and then you’ll know your systems better than anybody else. This will make the evaluation process simpler going forward. The final step is to submit a formal report to your customer or to the upper management and outline your results. You must always keep both parties in the loop to show them that their money was well spent.

**Moving On**

When you have finished the ethical hacking test, you’ll need to implement the analysis and also give the customer some recommendations. This will help to ensure the security of your systems. When you run these tests, new security vulnerabilities will appear. The information systems will always change, and these will become more complex. You’ll uncover new hacker exploits and more security vulnerabilities as time goes on.

A security test is a snapshot of how secure your systems are. You should remember that things can change at any time, especially when you add a new system, apply patches or upgrade the software. That’s why it’s important to have a plan by which you perform regular tests to assess the system’s security.

### Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks. <a href="#_dsf3r6tyo6dq" id="_dsf3r6tyo6dq"></a>

[3 in 1- A Comprehensive Beginner's Guide + Complete Tips And Tricks To Ethical Hacking + Learn Penetration Testing, Cybersecurity with Advanced Ethical Hacking Techniques and Methods Kindle Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Hacking-Comprehensive-Penetration-Cybersecurity-ebook/dp/B08NCQZ61P/ref=sr\_1\_7?crid=3BMIU3O7QWDA0\&keywords=ethical+hacking+career\&qid=1649665551\&sprefix=ethical+hacking+caree%2Caps%2C591\&sr=8-7\&asin=B08NCQZ61P\&revisionId=ef7a237f\&format=1\&depth=1)

A distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attack is performed by overloading a network or server with large volumes of traffic from different users and sources. Unlike a DoS, or denial-of-service, attack where only one Internet connection and one computer is used, different Internet connections and different computers are employed during a DDoS attack.

**Types of Attacks**

A DDoS attack can be placed in one of two categories:

* Volume-based attacks
* Application layer attacks

**Volume-Based Attacks**

A volume-based DDoS attack includes ICMP floods, UDP Floods, spoofed packet floods and TCP floods. These attacks are commonly known as Layer 3 and 4 attacks. The magnitude of an attack is measured in bits per second (bps).

**UDP Flood**

A UDP flood attack is often used to flood any random port on a remote host server. This attack is performed by sending UDP packets to the server, especially to the port number 53. You can use a specialized firewall to block or filter out any malicious UDP packets of data.

**ICMP Flood**

This type of attack is similar to the UDP flood and is often used to attack a remote host by sending several ICMP echo requests. In this type of attack, both the incoming and outgoing bandwidth is used, and a large number of ping requests will slow the system down.

**HTTP Flood**

In an HTTP flood attack, the hacker will send an HTTP POST and HTTP GET request to the target system or network in large volumes. The server cannot handle these volumes, and this will lead to a denial of any additional connections from a legitimate client.

**Amplification Attack**

In an amplification attack, a hacker will request the server, website or network to generate a large response and include a DNS request for PDFs, HTTP GET requests for images, TXT records and other data files.

**Application Layer Attacks**

There are many types of application layer attacks, including DDoS attacks targeting Apache or Windows, zero-day DDoS attacks, Slowloris, and others. The goal of the hacker is to crash the web server. The magnitude of the attack is measured in requests per second.

**Slowloris**

The attacker will send numerous HTTP headers to the target network or server, but no request is ever complete. The target server will need to keep all these connections open, which will lead to an overflow in the connection pool. This will ensure that the server does not accept any additional connections.

**Application Attack**

An application attack (also known as a Layer 7 attack) is where the hacker will overload any application through search requests, excessively logging in or a large amount of database lookups. It’s hard to identify this attack since it resembles legitimate traffic.

**NTP Amplification**

In this type of attack, the hacker will exploit the NTP as it’s accessible to the public. The hacker will perform actions that aim to overwhelm the target server.

**Zero-Day DDoS Attacks**

A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw in either the application or the system that was unknown to the user, and this vulnerability has not yet been patched or fixed. There are many types of attacks that are currently being identified that explore different vulnerabilities in the system.

**How to Overcome a DDoS Attack**

There are numerous DDoS protection tools that one can use depending on the type of attack. You can prevent a DDoS by identifying the vulnerabilities in an operating system and closing them. You also must ensure that you close every port connected to your system, thereby removing the probability of unwanted access to the system. You can also hide the system behind a VPN or a proxy server.

If the DDoS attack is low, you can use a firewall to filter out all the traffic that was sent to the network for the purpose of DDoS. If the magnitude of the attack is high, you should use a DDoS protection service provider. This tool will offer a proactive, genuine and holistic approach. You should always be careful when you select a DDoS protection service provider since there are quite a few who only want to take advantage of your situation. These providers will offer you numerous services at high costs if you let them know that your system was a victim of a DDoS attack.

You should look for a DDoS protection service provider that can be used to configure the CNAME and A records for the website. You should also look for a CDN provider that can monitor and analyze the DDoS traffic and will protect your system from an attack.

Let’s assume that the IP address you’re using is AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD. You should configure the address in the following way:

* Create an “A Record” using a DNS identifier, and ensure that you keep it secret.
* Next, use the CDN provider to assign a URL to the DNS identifier.
* Lastly, use the CDN URL to create a CNAME record.

You can ask your system administrator to help you with this task and verify that you’re configuring the CDN and DNS correctly. You will now have a DNS with the following configuration:

At this time, it’s advised that you let the CDN provider handle the attack on your system. The only condition is that you do not disclose your system’s A identifier or IP address.

**Quick Fix**

A DDoS attack is one of the most prevalent attacks performed on vulnerable networks and systems. Unfortunately, there’s no way to fix this problem quickly. If the system is under an attack, you should never panic, but instead start looking at the matter step by step.
